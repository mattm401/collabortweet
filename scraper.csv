They also prove that metal containers reflect the thermal properties of their surroundings rather than the temperature of their contents, and that while thermal imaging sees clearly through smoke, it is not able to penetrate fog.

Watching two different engines warm up using a $40,000 Flir T1K thermal camera. The cold starts weâll be observing include a 2016 Subaru Crosstrek on the left, which has a 2 liter boxer four-cylinder engine, and a 2002 Honda S2000 on the right, which has a 2 liter inline-four cylinder engine.

All of the temperature data points, one through five, represent the exact same thing for each vehicle, measured in Celsius. Point one is the exterior temperature of the oil filter, point 2 is the heater core coolant line, point three is the top radiator hose, point four is the front of the engine block, and point five is the intake manifold, before the air is distributed to each of the cylinders. Both of the engines start at the exact same time, so you can compare these figures directly based on the time stamp shown on screen.

On the right of each of the thermal images is a sliding scale, which adapts to the image and shows the temperature range on screen. The bottom number, in Celsius, and wherever there are dark spots, represents the coldest area. The top number, and wherever there are white spots, represents the hottest area.

Beneath their respective videos, we also have the air intake temperature, coolant temperature, and engine RPM read directly from the vehicle. For the duration of the video, the temperature of the ambient air around the car remained at about 7 degrees Celsius.
Finally, Iâve added a plot in the bottom right corner showing oil temperature with respect to time. This temperature comes from a thermal probe inserted down each of the vehicles dipstick tubes.

By this point, you can start to see that the intake manifold temperatures, point number 5, differ for each. The Crosstrek has a plastic manifold, elevated away from the engine, which does a better job of keeping intake temperatures down versus the aluminum manifold of the Honda, which is tucked within the engine bay and close to heat sources. By the end of the video, the Subaru has over a 20 degree advantage in intake temperatures versus the Honda, and yes, both of them are still pulling in the exact same 7 degree ambient air.

EMISSIVITY NOTE: For anyone concerned about emissivity and the temperatures you're witnessing, I just did a quick test in my kitchen to verify the temps we're seeing. I took a sheet of paper (emissivity ~0.9+) and a sheet of aluminum foil (emissivity ~0.05), while the camera was set for an emissivity of 0.95. The camera accurately read the temperature of both items (about 20 deg C). Then I switched the camera's emissivity to 0.04. The aluminum foil's temp then varied widely, from 0 deg C to 50 deg C (it was still at 20 deg C, the temperature inside my home), while the sheet of paper now incorrectly read 30 deg C. To me, this shows that with the camera set at 0.95 for emissivity, readings will be accurate, and it has a way of calibrating for various emissivity coefficients of what's in view. This video was recorded with emissivity set at 0.95.

In this video weâre checking out a burnout with a Honda S2000 and a Flir T1K thermal camera. Itâs pretty mesmerizing to watch, as the tread surface of the tire raises from about 19 degrees Celsius to over 160 degrees in less than five seconds.

Shout out to Braden Carlson for the epic burnout while I filmed! His channel here:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8agwGsx8arC9URdrgCY6cw

You can see the heat the tires lay down onto the ground with perfect lines for the tire grooves. The tires themselves are spitting out bits of melted rubber which coats the ground, rear fender, and inside the wheel wells.

I decided to change the tire pressure left to right to see if there were any differences. The right tire has a pressure of 27 psi, 5 below recommended, while the left tire is at 37 psi, 5 above recommended. Ultimately, it made very little difference as both tires were evenly melted across the tread pattern. Thereâs simply too much friction for too long to notice a significant difference.

If we analyze the burnout at a much lower frame rate from the very beginning, we can see that on the under-inflated tire, the left portion of the tire heats up first. This is actually because the rear tire is out of alignment, and has excessive negative cambers, so the load on the tire rests primarily on the inside. If the tire were to have the correct factory alignment, the heating would occur much more evenly.

The tire surface temperature, in just four frames, less than 1/7th of a second, increases from 19 celsius to 43.5. In less than two seconds, the surface temperature of the inside of the tire reaches 160 degrees, or about 320 degrees Fahrenheit, and by five seconds, the entire tread is roasting above 160.

After the burnout, you can see the garage floor covered in hot rubber, and the rear brakes have heated to over 300 degrees Celsius or about 600 Fahrenheit. The rotors even got a bit of color from getting so hot. The tires themselves have now turned into a pile of debris. Itâs time for newer, nicer, wider rubber.

Should You Warm Up Your Engine? - https://youtu.be/xKALgXDwou4

Data Overlay OBD2 Link - http://amzn.to/2fZMYi3

In this video weâre going to be cold starting the engine of my 2016 Subaru Crosstrek, and using a thermal camera weâre going to watch the engine heat up. The ambient temperature is about negative 6 degrees Celsius or about 22 degrees Fahrenheit. As far as metrics weâll be monitoring, weâve got overlays of the engine RPM, which will run higher when the engine first starts to help warm things up. We also have throttle position, the coolant and intake air temperatures, the temperature of where the thermal camera is centered, and a timestamp so we know how long the engine has been running.

If itâs freezing outside and you donât want to get in a frozen car, no oneâs going to fault you for warming up the engine and making sure itâs comfortable inside, as well as making sure the windows are defrosted so youâre ready to roll. In my video I was purely discussing whatâs happening from a mechanical standpoint when you let your engine sit and idle.

Oil can actually flow at very low temperatures. You may be freezing, but for certain viscosity grades cold temperatures arenât a huge deal. For example, my Honda S2000 recommends a 10W-30 oil, and it only recommends going down to a thinner 5W grade oil if ambient temperatures drop below minus 20 degrees C. Minus 20 degrees C! And this is logical based on SAE cold temperature viscosity ratings.

For example, a 0W oil needs to be able to pump at -40 degrees C. A 5W oil needs to be able to pump at -35 degrees C. A 10W oil needs to be able to flow at -30 degrees C, and so on. Oil can do a decent job of protecting your engine even at low temperatures, as long as youâre not asking the engine for too much power. Try to keep the revs low, and be light on the throttle until the engine is warmed up. Getting up to higher vehicle speeds is fine, as long as your acceleration is gentle and steady, and youâre mindful of your engine RPM. Source: http://www.viscopedia.com/viscosity-tables/substances/sae-viscosity-grades/

Now inevitably someone in the comments is going to say they live in an area with negative 40 degrees C temps and they always warm there car up for several minutes before taking off. A couple of things to note here: first, thatâs obviously super cold, and I canât blame you for wanting the interior to be warm. Second, make sure youâre using a viscosity grade that can flow in these conditions. 0W is designed for this. Third, with temperatures this low, itâs a good idea to get an electric engine block heater so your engine wonât have to strain so hard to get oil flowing throughout.

At about 5 minutes and 20 seconds, when the coolant temperature reaches 50 degrees C, youâll notice the engine RPM starts to significantly drop, eventually getting down to 800 RPM when the coolant reaches 60 degrees C.

yEXLLh0AXv0,Is Seekâs $200 Thermal Camera Any Good?,"Back at CES, we were amazed at the $349 price tag on the FlirONEâ¦ thatâs hundreds (if not thousands) less than a microbolometer has ever cost before. Now weâve got Seekâs $200 thermal camera in for resting. It plugs into the MicroUSB port on Android devices and the Lightning connector on iOS gear. Is it any good? Watch the video to find out what we were able to do with the beta software!

BZPZfrgbkUQ,High Resolution Thermal Camera 'unboxed',"FYI polyethylene is just a simple thermal window for the camera, that also keeps the camera dry and out of the way of humidity.

The camera (optris pi640) is actually (on the grand scale of things) a midrange camera. Indeed when FLIR came and showed me their cameras, their top camera cost over $100 000!

The FLIR cameras were about twice the price of the Optris cameras (spec for spec).  They are clearly nice, better produced cameras.  However the software to drive them was extortionate. It was almost half the cost of the cameras for the range I was looking at!
The Optris cameras have comparable specs, but the focus is strictly manual (IIRC, the FLIR cameras had autofocus and quick change lenses... you dont get any of that with Optris).

However the bottom line was.
Optris 640*480.... comparable price flir 320*240
frame rates comparable for both
temperature sensitivity comparable for both ~0.05 K
temperature range, both ~-20 to ~1000C
In reality you could get an extra filter for the FLIR, which took it up to ~2000C which would have been useful.  Sadly you have to make your compromises :-(",Thunderf00t,2016-08-06 16:42:14,64586,54,Entertainment,"""Thermal Camera"""

Built for the realities of work and play, the Seek Reveal handheld imager combines powerful thermal insight and a high-performance light in one durable device.

See through the dark. Light optional. Revealâs advanced infrared technology lets you see thermal images even in the darkest night. And when you need it, Revealâs powerful 300-lumen LED light makes sure you know exactly whatâs out there.

Military-proven technology, tough enough for the toolbox. Life can get pretty dirty. So Reveal can, too. You can count on its rugged, rubberized casing and intuitive controls to go and work where you doâno matter what conditions you face.

Same clarity and resolution as the original Seek Thermal camera, but twice the magnification and a focus-able lens for precise macro thermal imaging.
Over 32,000 individual thermal pixels with a range of detecting temperatures from -40C to 300C
Prior to Seek Thermal, this type of resolution was only available in cameras costing $3,000 and above
Perfect for Hunters, Boaters, Outdoor Enthusiasts, Home Owners, and Electrical Engineers.
Works in total darkness, broad daylight, or obscured visibility conditions.

The raw thermal images can be downloaded from http://goo.gl/APXp3n.

Please apply the pause button liberally to view the slides as the video moves along pretty quickly (the ""K"" button on your keyboard will pause the video if you're viewing on a desktop).

The thermal videos were taken using a dynamic temperature scale.  The still thermal images with temperature points have been normalized to the same temp scale. The still images can be compared 1:1.

If you've got suggestions for other insulation tests please let us know and we'll do our best to test it out.

I really hope ya'll like the video - it took us a couple of weekends to get the proper footage for the video and the PDF report.  I hope it's entertaining / helpful.  Happy trails!

Infiniti custom build EO/IR Electro optics and Infrared cameras used for  1-40 miles long range  day night Surveillance for security and defense for homeland security , coastal surveillance, military and marine that are IP 67 MIL8-10-STD military rated  for vibration, shock, and extreme temperatures.

Phone: 1.866.200.9191

Infiniti electro optics custom builds Thermal uncooled LWIR & Cooled MWIR, SWIR, INGAS, MCT, INSB, and HD Visible and NIR  multi sensor long range PTZ camera system that are affordable and military grade.

MIL-STD-810F/G IP 67 -50~60Â°C
The entire system is designed for the most demanding mobile applications. It is MIL-STD-810F/G tested and certified and is sealed to a minimum of IP66 making it water and dust proof. Its internal heater/blower allows it operate in conditions from â50Â°C to +65Â°C and both the pan/tilt and enclosure use a tough anti corrosion finish for continued operation in the most brutal and harsh climatic conditions.


DICE Dynamic Image Optimization vs DDE Digital Detail Enchancment

Real time Thermal infrared image optimization via advanced image processing DICE is much more than simple digital detail edge enhancement.  DICE powered by  DRS proprietary Edge Enhancement and optimization techniques coupled with Dynamic Contrast Thresholding and Adaptive Rescaling. Unlike other digital detail enhancement technologies on the market,  DICE is dynamic intelligent image optimization  for incremental and proportionate response making superior to to image contrast enhancement that is done digitally making Infiniti thermal cameras far superior resulting increased ranges and sharper images compared to other infrared sensors.

See it All Thermal Infrared
Infinitiâs thermal cameras let you see further than any other night vision technology. Thermal cameras, unlike traditional visible cameras, use heat rather than light to see an object. Humans, animals, and vehicles are very hot in contrast to most backgrounds making trespassers hiding in shadows or bushes easy to spot. Thermal images are also unaffected by bright light and have the ability to see through atmospheric obstructions such as smoke, dust, and light fog. This makes it an ideal technology for a number of applications, including but not limited to surveillance and security, search and rescue, fire, marine and land navigation, and wide area situational assessment.


IP  2MP Visible Optical HD Camera
The visible camera uses a 1/2.8"" progressive scan CMOS sensor with an HD resolution of 1920Ã1080 and a fantastic signal to noise ratio of 55dB. The 1/2.8"" sensor has excellent spectral sensitivity for both visible and NIR wavelengths and features an automatic IR cut filter, making it a true day/night camera providing clear colour images by day and black and white images at night. The 1/2.8"" sensor provides the best balance between light sensitivity and maximum zoom, making it particularly suited for long range surveillance. The Sentry also integrates the latest technology in real-time image processing such as BLC, HLC, DWDR, EIS, ROI, 3D DNR, ABF, Defog/Haze etc. Each of these image enhancements can be automatic or user-defined and calibrated based on the application requirements. Since the camera is native IP, all of these settings can be changed and configured remotely, along with remote PTZ and zoom control.

They are many competent manufactures of thermal and visible cameras but often they are only skilled at one of them and push their customers into either thermal or visible. Infiniti is highly experienced and have implemented a host of camera technologies that include but not limited to Visible, Thermal, Active IR, Range Gated, SWIR, Starlight, cooled thermal. Infiniti designs and manufactures multi sensor systems to leverage the benefit of all of these technologies into integrated camera systems that operate as one unfiled system. Infiniti custom builds cameras to suit the individual needs of our customers and has proud and rich history of being the premier manufacture for night vision electro-optics.

The video is a compilation of selected day and night footage recorded by OSCE SMM thermal camera installed in Shyrokyne, Donetsk region during July-August 2016. Most of the observations depicted in the video were recorded using the thermal sensor, mainly during night time, when the majority of such incidents occur. All observations in the video constitute violations of Minsk agreements.
The Mission works 24/7 and observations made during day and night are published in our reports on a daily basis. The SMM dispatches around 90 patrols a day throughout Ukraine on both sides of the contact line.
At night time we use various technologies â mainly, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), static cameras and other aerial surveillance. Additionally, night time observations are being conducted by SMM monitors from 14 different locations throughout conflict zone who listen and record ceasefire violation.

YFUKtuKUOmE,Best Long range cooled thermal camera,"The M Series cooled MWIR Thermal imaging cameras offer very high sensitivity & high resolution at F4 continuous zoom lenses. The M Series Cooled MWIR thermal FLIR cameras are affordable while giving the user ultra long range standoff imaging performance up to 55 Kilometers.

www.x20.org

Cooled thermal camera lenses are needed for a thermal sensor to fulfill its ultimate purpose. Highly sensitive InSb and MCT sensors are only half of the equation. To truly leverage the power of cooled thermal sensors, you need a good lens. So, what makes a good lens? Like everything of quality in life there is no one data marker that you can point to and say; âoh well if it has that then it must be the bestâ. Rather, it is a combination of factors that determine a lenses quality. The main specifications of a thermal lens include: the lenses focal length, f/#, coating, alignment with the thermal sensor, size of the thermal sensor, pixel pitch of the thermal sensor, athermalization of the lens and environmental housing. That is a lot of factors. I am sure that you can now see that the question is not âwhat is the best cooled thermal lensâ but âwhat is the RIGHT thermal lens for my needsâ?  So, with all these specifications to juggle how do I know what is the right thermal lens to choose? Lets start by looking at some of these options and figuring out what they mean.

FOCAL LENGTH-  When discussing long range cooled thermal camera lenses, this is going to be the first specification you come across. Quite simply the focal length is the distance from the front of the optic to the point at the back where it focuses the energy that you are imaging. In the world of long range thermal imaging it is generally assumed that a longer focal length is used to see farther distances. A longer focal length will also result in a narrower field of view.  So, with long lenses you can see farther away but you see a narrower area. For example (numbers made up for ease of calculation)  if a 100mm lens could see a person at 1,000 meters and had a horizontal field of view of 15 degrees, then a 1500mm lens could see a person at 15,000 meter but would have a narrow horizontal field of view of only 1 degree. This makes it easy to see far but difficult to track targets closely. That is where the cooled thermal camera ZOOM lens comes in to play.  For long range thermal surveillance, the right lens in this example would be a 100mm-1500mm continuous zoom optic. This type of cooled thermal camera zoom lens provides a 100mm FOV, a 1500mm FOV and every FOV in between.  The thermal zoom lens makes it easy to select the perfect FOV for the target you need to track.

www.x20.org

COATING- All cooled thermal camera lenses are coated in order to perform properly and reduce unwanted stray energy.  The basic anti-reflective coating is standard on all thermal lenses and is designed to eliminate that stray energy. Better lenses have whats called a DLC or HDLC coating. The Hard Diamond Like Coating of these lenses protects them from atmospheric pitting and blowing dust. In long range thermal imaging this matters.  The size of these lenses usually means that the lens front element is exposed to the environment in the housing. The shear size of the lens prevents the use of IR transparent windows since they need to be so large and thick to cover the objective lens diameter.  The quality of the coating is the most important thing to keep in mind.

fW4Nx_kz6RU,Raymarine FLIR Thermal Camera,"Thermal cameras are now well within reach of the trailer boat market with FLIR launching the M132 and M232 thermal imaging cameras. Boatadvice.com.au journalist Dom Wiseman recently got a first-hand look at the units. The M132 is a tilt only option. It points directly ahead and can move only up or down while the M232 is a pan and tilt camera. It can spin 360 degrees in addition to move up and down.
The cost of these units are considerably less than anything previously available with the M132 priced from $3,595 and the M232, $4,995. With the recent reductions in radar it makes the perfect accompaniment and the FLIR units complement the Raymarine Axiom Multi Function Display with a plug and play operation with the addition of a HS-5 switch.

The cameras use infra red to see what's ahead by separating temperature differences down to 0.1 degree allowing boaters to see and identify obstacles. A radar will show you an object but it sometimes takes a little time to establish what exactly you are looking at. The new thermal cameras are useful in direct sunlight, heavy fog/sea mist and of course darkness. You can combine them with radar enabling you to identify wharves, pylons, buoys and of course other boats.

The M232 was designed to be the smallest, lightest and least power consuming infra red thermal camera. It allows vision in 320 x 240 and both units come with a 4X digital zoom allowing fast identifications. The effective operable distance depends on the size of the object but as best we could identify the unit can see a ferry at around 1.3 kilometres while a smaller object like a person in the water is 450 metres.

Boatadvice.com.au got to experience the true capabilities of the thermal units simulating a man overboard scenario at night on Pittwater.

NKi3jEPdzpM,Review of FLIR E6 Thermal Camera Features,"http://www.ivytools.com/FLIR-E6-Infrared-Thermal-Imaging-Camera-63902-0202-p/flir-e6.htm

The FLIR E6 thermal camera offers an excellent combination of performance and price in a camera that is versatile enough to perform many common infrared applications. For building inspection purposes, the E6 meets all standards including RESNET. It has enough resolution (19,200 pixels) and sensitivity (0.06 C) to diagnose air leakage, missing insulation, moisture intrusion and more. For mechanical applications, the FLIR E6 easily images overheating bearings, motors, and electrical circuits, and is great for locating ductwork and plumbing hidden in walls and slabs.

With both thermal and visible light cameras, the E6 is ready to document all problem areas for your report. The E6 can also overlay the images in a picture-in-picture format. The best use of the digital camera, however, is found in FLIR's MSX thermal image enhancement. This real-time process overlays the data from the digital image onto the thermal image, with the effect that you can understand the visible world easily, yet without any loss of thermal data.

Like the other Ex-Series infrared cameras, the FLIR E6 is fitted with a 45 degree wide angle lens, perfect for getting a great view while in tight quarters. Now you can image more of a target with less backing away to get the perfect shot. The E6 will store up to 500 sets of images for convenient playback on the camera or download to a computer. FLIR Tools reporting software is included with the camera for both PC and Mac platforms. FLIR Tools allows for organization and annotation of images, and creates great reports for presenting your findings.",Ivy Tools,2014-05-06 1:56:59,7963,0,Science & Technology,"""Thermal Camera"""

Website: www.infinitioptics.com

Infiniti Electro Optics custom builds EO/IR long range PTZ Multi sensor thermal and visible cameras and has a variety of off the shelf models with their Integrated motorized optical Fog/Haze filter. Their motorized filter when combined with their long range optimized surveillance sensor provides up to 6x the resolution of thermal, 10x the distance of thermal and images on par with SWIR imaging to see through MIST, Haze, Fog. www.infinitioptics.com

Long Range 128X Continuous Zoom Lens with Fog Filter & Auto Focus The Viper, Sigma and Sentinel cam be equipped with a precision engineered 16â2050 IR-corrected continuous zoom lens with motorized HD doubler, offering an incredible 128X zoom range from 19Â° through to a very narrow 0.15Â° FOV when paired with the 1/2.8"" sensor. That's equivalent to a âfull-frameâ DSLR camera using a 13,500mm lens! Infinitiâs zoom optics are built with the highest quality ELD low dispersion glass. The lens also incorporates a motorized fog filter that is used with the cameraâs monochrome mode and de-haze image processing to see through fog, smoke, smog and haze that render standard optical cameras unusable.

HD Starlight High Definition Progressive Scan 1/2.8 Sensor
The Viperâs visible camera was designed and optimized for long range surveillance. It uses a 1/2.8"" progressive scan CMOS sensor with an HD resolution of 1920Ã1080 and a fantastic signal to noise ratio of 55dB. The 1/2.8"" sensor has excellent spectral sensitivity for both visible and NIR wavelengths and features an automatic IR cut filter, making it a true day/night camera providing clear color images by day and black and white images at night. The 1/2.8"" sensor provides the best balance between light sensitivity and maximum zoom, making it particularly suited for long range surveillance.

Real Time Image Optimization & Enhancements
The Viper also integrates the latest technology in real-time image processing such as BLC, HLC, DWDR, EIS, ROI, 3D DNR, ABF, Defog/ Haze etc. Each of these image enhancements can be automatic or user-defined and calibrated based on the application requirements. Since the camera is native IP, all of these settings can be changed and configured remotely, along with remote PTZ and zoom control

5km IR ZLID Zoom Infrared Active IR Laser Illumination
Many laser illuminators overexpose the center of the screen and leave the edges dark. Our laser has an adjustable 0.22Â° to 60Â° angle of view, and Infinitiâs ZLID (Zoom Laser IR Diode) technology synchronizes IR intensity and area illumination with the zoom lens for outstanding active IR performance, eliminating over-exposure, washout, and hot-spots for clear images in complete darkness. An optional LRF is also available that can automatically turn off the laser if an object is detected within 95m of the active ZLID.

The Viper has Gyro Stabilized a weapons systems grade positioner designed for military applications and is able to withstand shock and vibration for use on tanks and navy vessels. The pan tilt implements a strain wave gear for high torque to handle large payloads while providing micro steps as precise as 0.00025Â° for smooth manual control or automatic slew to cue tracking when used with Video Analytics, VTMS systems, Radar, AIS and weapon systems. The integrated multi-axis gyro stabilization uses a high-rate MEMS gyro in combination with the pan/tilt to mechanically stabilize the payload.

Electro Optics EO/ IR Imaging Filters for UV, IR Visible Cameras
Infiniti Optics has a wide variety of motorized spectral filters that can be integrated to compensate or eliminate the effects of parasitic light conditions such as fog, smoke, haze, heat-waves, UV and IR to optimize image clarity and resolution long long range surveillance imaging .

iL8Sq1SQKRM,"CAT S60 review - FLIR thermal Camera sample, performance, battery performance","Here is the CAT S60 review, this handset is available in India, it is pricey but a lot different from the others smartphones. S60 is world's first smartphone to feature a built in FLIR Thermal Camera.

CAT S60 unboxing
The box pack is yellow color, and inside you will get the handset, a screen guard, user manual, warranty information booklet, data cable and travel charger 5V/2A. Earphone is not included. SAR value as mentioned on the box 0.854 W/kg@1g Head and  0.557 W/kg@1g body.

#CATS60 Design, Display and OS
The S60 is a rugged smartphone and like other rugged smartphone this one is made to survive falls and hence has extra layer of protection. The frame that is being used is made of die-cast steel frame - it is really tough almost impossible to bend.

The overall protection makes the handset feel quite bulky but the weight is quite acceptable. Weight with battery is 223 grams and thickness is 12.66mm. The handset is so tough (rugged) that it will survive a drop from 6 feet (condition that the screen should not get a direct / pointed hit - example a sharp object hit to screen, in that case the screen will break but handset will survive).

This is a dual SIM handset with 4G LTE support however VoLTE support is missing, you can use Jio4GVoice to make calls using Reliance Jio SIM. There are dual nano SIM slots and a separate micro SD card slot that can use 128GB external cards.

There is LED notification and good number of sensors - accelerometer, proximity, light, gyro, magnetic and pressure.
S60 sports a 4.7 inch screen with HD resolution. Color reproduction, viewing angles and touch response are very good. The screen also comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. Do note that though Gorilla Glass 4 is tough it is breakable.
Android Marshmallow version 6.0 runs out of the box.

CAT S60 Memory and Storage
The CAT S60 is packed with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage.

CAT S60 Performance
This handset is using well known Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 MSM8952 octa core processor @ 1.5GHz coupled with Adreno 405 GPU. Performance was smooth, lag free and max battery temperature I encountered was 43 degrees.

CAT S60 Benchmark
Quadrant : 22099
AnTuTu : 45369 / 7487
Nenamark 2 : 60 fps
Disk Speed :  145 MB/s read / 71 MB/s write
Multi Touch : 10 point

CAT S60 Gaming

Hardware is powerful and it easily played Modern Combat 5 and Asphalt 8 in high quality mode without any lags.

CAT S60 Camera

There is  13MP camera on the rear and 5MP on the front. Camera quality is below average not really that good, captures okay quality images in daylight and hardly anything in low light. FHD video can be recorded and video quality is decent.

Camera Rating 2.5 out of 5

CAT S60 FLIR Thermal Camera

This is something unique and no other smartphone comes equipped with.  The #FLIR Thermal Camera can detect heat signature and gives you a different view of the surrounding. Basically using a Thermal Camera you can easily know the Heat source and you can also use this in complete dark Environment.
The Thermal Camera can be used to know the area on a laptop / smartphone that is heating up, to detect leakages, to detect heat source and also to detect movements for security purpose. The thermal camera interface comes with some filter and you can capture still thermal shots or even record thermal videos.

Others

The CAT S60 comes with a dedicated button that can be programmed and a SOS button too. You need to assign contact numbers. During an emergency press the SOS button and an SMS with your location will be sent to your pre-defined contacts.

Waterproof

This S60 handset can survive up to 5 meter depth for 60 minutes. There are special switch with 2M/5M markings near the speaker vents on front face bottom and top (Check video review). You need to use the appropriate switch when using handset under water. The handset can record underwater videos.

The 5M switch will seal off the speaker vents as they could get damaged at 5M pressure. There is  a speaker dry app that you can use in case for some reason water enters the speaker vent.


CAT S60 Battery

The S60 houses a 3800 mAh non-removable battery with quick charge 2.0 support. On a full charge you can expect 4 to 6 hours of non-stop moderate to heavy usage. It will give you an easy 1 day of mixed usage.

CAT S60 Battery Performance

â¢ Running Benchmark app â 10 minutes / 5% /  35 degree
â¢ Asphalt 8 + MC5 game play â 29 minutes / 11% / 43 degree
â¢ FHD video play back - 24 minutes / 6% / 37 degree

It took me 2 hours 45 minutes to charge the handset from 0% to 100% using wall charger.

Verdict

Now if this thermal camera can be of any use in your business or profession then you can think of buying this handset, thermal technology is not cheap. However if thermal camera is of no use then makes no sense.

Rating 4.2 out of 5

CAT S60 price is Rs. 64,999.

esjcnP9Uxdg,Review of FLIR E8 Thermal Camera Features,"http://www.ivytools.com/FLIR-E8-Infrared-Thermal-Imaging-Camera-63903-0303-p/flir-e8.htm

The FLIR E8 thermal camera offers one of the best values in infrared: full 320 x 240 imaging for just $3995. Many cameras in this price range offer just one fourth of the resolution of the the E8. With 76,800 pixels, it has the resolution to isolate even very small areas of concern. And with 0.06 C thermal sensitivity, the FLIR E8 can detect subtle temperature patterns associated with air infiltration, water intrusion, and mechanical friction.

With the incorporated digital camera, the FLIR E8 captures digital and thermal images with every squeeze of the trigger. It can also combine these images live on the screen in what is called MSX dynamic imaging. With MSX the thermal and digital images are combined in real time to reveal the detail of the visible picture without compromising the data of the thermal image. You can read signs, serial numbers, and even see the pattern on the carpet.

The E8 also offers a few features not included on some of its FLIR Ex-Series siblings. In addition to the thermal and MSX views, the E8 includes the popular picture-in-picture format. Also included is an isotherm function, placing a special palette on  an area above or below a user-set temperature. New to the E8 is the option to manually adjust the temperature level and span to better isolate a temperature range of interest.

The FLIR E8 thermal camera comes standard with the extras that a professional needs to make the most of a day's work, including two batteries and an external charger. The flash memory can store up to 500 image sets for recall on the camera or download to your PC or Mac computer.

Qnd1HalzWyw,Locate A Honey Bee Hive With A FLIR ONE Thermal Camera for ios,"I bought a FLIR ONE camera for Iphone 6 a couple of months ago and I've used it on several hive location and removal jobs where the exact location of the hive was difficult to determine.  It works really good and has prevented a lot of unnecessary tear of building materials.  It is best to use it early in the morning before the sun heats everything up since it picks up on temperature contrasts.  I even used it to locate a plumbing leak in a concrete slab.

We received this lock from http://www.slotenonline.be
They challenged us to destroy this lock with the press, so we took on the challenge !

I set up a Thermal Camera and also filmed the pressure gauge while pressing.

The lock exploded when the press reached 26Tons.

The lock was thrown against the Ipad, which got destroyed in the process.

On this video you can see the aftermath that was caused by the explosion of the padlock.

This was a pretty tough lock, but no match for the press :)

Result :

- Wrecked Ipad
- Exploded Padlock
- Challenge Succeeded

z1FWPHiVOt8,HD Cooled thermal camera,"Cooled HD INSB MWIR thermal camera systems are the clear choice for long range imaging. This is due to the highly sensitive FPA technology they employ. Typically, a cooled thermal camera will utilize either InSb or MCT sensor materials. These are very good materials for a thermal array in the 3-5 micron range. However, Focal Plane Arrays made from these materials do require cryogenic cooling in order to function at their peak performance level. That is why they are called âcooled thermal cameraâ systems. But, when these exotic sensor materials are combined with an appropriate cooling system, the result is a thermal imaging system that boasts MRTDâs on the order of 20mk or less. In practical terms this equates to 3-4 times the sensitivity of uncooled thermal camera systems. The sensitivity of cooled sensors, allows us to use much smaller lenses (f/4-f/5.5). It follows that, given a certain envelope of space, we can fit a much longer focal length lens into a cooled thermal camera design than any other technology would allow. When ultimate distance matters, long range cooled thermal camera systems are the only option.



http://www.x20.org/product/m7-ptz-long-range-thermal-imager/



Exotic materials are used to produce the focal plane array sensors that are used in cooled thermal cameras.  The most common are Indium Antimonide (InSb) and Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe).



The InSb (commonly referred to as Ins-Bee or reticulated insb) sensor material is a narrow gap semiconductor in crystaline form.  It is sensitive to wavelengths of 1Âµm to 5Âµm but is typically filtered, in cooled thermal camera systems, to 3Âµm to 5Âµm. InSb detectors have long been the leading choice for imaging systems that feature long range thermal optics.  It is a reliable and mature sensor technology that is manufactured in various countries around the world. The InSb detector does require cryogenic cooling to operate at peak efficiency and produce a usable thermal image. In the past ,this was accomplished by a dewar that needed to be filled with Liquid Nitrogen. The dewars are long gone. Now,highly efficient cryo coolers manage the task of cooling down to ~80Â°K.



The HgCdTe (commonly referred to as MCT or Mer-Cad) sensor material is a narrow direct bandgap zincblende.  MCT sensors are tuned to operate in wavelengths from 1Âµm all the way to 14Âµm. They are a versatile sensor material.  Unlike InSb sensors, MCT sensors produce cooled thermal camera systems that access both atmospheric transmission windows of 3Âµm to 5Âµm and 7Âµm to 14Âµm. Most people think of cooled cameras as always being MWIR (3Âµm-5Âµm).  MCT materials produce a cooled thermal camera that is MWIR or LWIR (7Âµm to 14Âµm).  MCT focal plane arrays also require cryogenic cooling to ~80Â°K.



Hot MCT is a relatively new technology utilizing Mer Cad based sensors.  The new âHOTâ sensors operate at warmer temperatures than the InSb and traditional HgCdTe chips. Instead of cooling to 80Â°K the HOT MCT only needs to be cooled to 160Â°K. In practical terms this greatly reduces the load on the cryo cooler. This creates a cooled thermal camera that starts up faster, has a longer cooler lifespan and uses less power.  This is fantastic for SWaP efforts.  The Hot MCT is a new development that is very promising but only time will tell if it proves to be the future of cooled thermal.



n conclusion, cooled thermal camera systems incorporate different sensor materials but offer distinct advantages when used in long range and ultra long range thermal imaging platforms. The key is the increased sensitivity and smaller lens sizes.  Next time, we will discuss lens options for your cooled thermal camera.

Before every hunt at the Haunted Lake House I do a quick daytime check a few hours before so I won't have any nasty surprises. Today I took my FLIR (Forward Looking Infra-Red) thermal camera and believe I captured a couple of spirits.  Although pareidolia is always a concern the FLIR never presented man shaped images anywhere but in the kitchen - a hot spot for spirit activity.  EVPs were captured that not only confirmed spirits were present but they warned other spirits to ""get down"" at the site of the camera and did so angrily. After the warning no images were seen again. Then numerous spirits complained that what I'm doing is awful. They do NOT want to be filmed.

-4ohP9h31VU,Finding Bigfoot Vermont Bigfoot Caught on Thermal Camera,"The bigfoot team descends on a Georgia forest with night vision and thermal imaging cameras to find a Sasquatch also. The PattersonâGimlin film (also known as the Patterson film or the PGF) is a famous short motion picture of an unidentified subject the filmmakers said was a Bigfoot. The footage was shot in 1967, and has since been subjected to many attempts to authenticate or debunk it. Several university based studies and professional evaluations have concluded the subject cannot possibly be a man in an ape suit. However, others have judged it to be a hoax staged with a man in an ape suit.

The footage was filmed alongside Bluff Creek, a tributary of the Klamath River, about 25 logging-road miles northwest of Orleans, California, in Del Norte County. The film site is roughly 38 miles south of Oregon and 18 miles east of the Pacific Ocean.[2] For decades, the exact location of the site was lost, primarily because of re-growth of foliage in the streambed after the flood of 1964. It was rediscovered in 2011.[3][4][5]

The filmmakers were Roger Patterson (February 14, 1933 â January 15, 1972) and Robert ""Bob"" Gimlin (born October 18, 1931). Patterson died of cancer in 1972 and ""maintained right to the end that the creature on the film was real.""[6] Patterson's friend, Gimlin, has always denied being involved in any part of a hoax with Patterson. Gimlin mostly avoided publicly discussing the subject from at least the early 1970s until about 2005 (except for three appearances),[7] when he began giving interviews and appearing at Bigfoot conferences.[8][9]

The film is 23.85 feet long (preceded by 76.15 feet of ""horseback"" footage), has 954 frames,[10] and runs for 59.5 seconds at 16 frames per second. If the film was shot at 18 fps, as Grover Krantz believes,[11] the event lasted 53 seconds. The date was October 20, 1967, according to the filmmakers, although some critics believe it was shot earlier.[12][13][14][15]",Ben Halvorson,2016-03-26 20:02:08,1508,1,Travel & Events,"""Thermal Camera"""

7Fou9u42ToU,Clip on turns smartphone into thermal camera,"(28 Feb 2017) LEADIN:
A simple clip on that allows smartphones to use thermal imaging is being displayed at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona.
Thermal imaging cameras are more often associated with earthquake rescue teams, but the makers of the third generation Flir One camera say it's now small and cheap enough to be used around the home.
STORYLINE:
This is the Flir one clip-on thermal imaging camera.
It clips on a the bottom of any Apple or Android phone to give a thermal image, revealing the temperature of any object.
""Thermal camera, what it does, is that it looks at the heat and the environment around you and it creates an image of that heat pattern,"" says Mike Walters, the Flir product manager.
But why would anyone need a thermal image of the temperature of their surroundings?
It can obviously be a bit of fun to see how friends, family and pets look like through a thermal camera.
But it could also be useful when making home improvements says Walters.
""To do an energy audit of your house for example, find places where you might be missing insulation or have energy leaks around windows or doors.""
The third generation of the Flir One smartphone attachment will be available this year for $199 US dollars.
The camera is capable of detecting temperatures ranging from -20 to +120 degrees Celsius (-4ÃÂ°F to 248ÃÂ°F).
""It used to be that a thermal camera you were talking 10,000 dollars and it was really something that was limited to the lab or limited to professional uses,"" says Walters.
""But we have now created a smaller form factor so that it basically every day consumers can get their hands on it and benefit from the technology.""
The MWC technology show runs until March 2nd 2017.

The FLIR C2 Thermal Camera is the first pocket size infrared camera with a full set of professional features. The C2 uses an 80 x 60 resolution thermal detector plus a 640 x 480 visible light camera to help you locate trouble spots in building, mechanical, and electrical installations. Temperature differences as small as 0.10 C can be detected by the FLIR C2, meaning that you can better locate gaps in insulation, or visualize air leakage around windows and doors. Other common applications include spot checks of electrical equipment for dangerous connections, or quick inspections of mechanical equipment to confirm proper function.

The FLIR C2 Thermal Camera records both a thermal image and a visible image with each press of the large capture button. The camera can store up to 500 sets of images for later download in the free FLIR Tools software. Downloaded images can be further analyzed using the many available tools in the software, or combined with your own notes to create a professional report. Images can also be exported to be included in the software of your choice.

Since the C2 includes both a thermal and digital camera, it can also combine these images into one new, detail-rich picture. The resulting MSX image has all the data from the thermal image, plus details such as patterns and edges from the visible photo. This results in an image that seems much clearer, making the FLIR C2 a more useful thermal imager than even some cameras that have greater resolution.",Ivy Tools,2015-03-02 4:59:04,1858,0,Science & Technology,"""Thermal Camera"""

It's not perfect all the time as the thermal camera sometimes lags behind due to it is calibrating.

C-VtasU1WBQ,INSB Thermal camera,"Cooled thermal camera systems are the clear choice for long range imaging. This is due to the highly sensitive FPA technology they employ. Typically, a cooled thermal camera will utilize either InSb or MCT sensor materials. These are very good materials for a thermal array in the 3-5 micron range. However, Focal Plane Arrays made from these materials do require cryogenic cooling in order to function at their peak performance level. That is why they are called âcooled thermal cameraâ systems. But, when these exotic sensor materials are combined with an appropriate cooling system, the result is a thermal imaging system that boasts MRTDâs on the order of 20mk or less. In practical terms this equates to 3-4 times the sensitivity of uncooled thermal camera systems. The sensitivity of cooled sensors, allows us to use much smaller lenses (f/4-f/5.5). It follows that, given a certain envelope of space, we can fit a much longer focal length lens into a cooled thermal camera design than any other technology would allow. When ultimate distance matters, long range cooled thermal camera systems are the only option.



http://www.x20.org/product/m7-ptz-long-range-thermal-imager/



Exotic materials are used to produce the focal plane array sensors that are used in cooled thermal cameras.  The most common are Indium Antimonide (InSb) and Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe).



The InSb (commonly referred to as Ins-Bee or reticulated insb) sensor material is a narrow gap semiconductor in crystaline form.  It is sensitive to wavelengths of 1Âµm to 5Âµm but is typically filtered, in cooled thermal camera systems, to 3Âµm to 5Âµm. InSb detectors have long been the leading choice for imaging systems that feature long range thermal optics.  It is a reliable and mature sensor technology that is manufactured in various countries around the world. The InSb detector does require cryogenic cooling to operate at peak efficiency and produce a usable thermal image. In the past ,this was accomplished by a dewar that needed to be filled with Liquid Nitrogen. The dewars are long gone. Now,highly efficient cryo coolers manage the task of cooling down to ~80Â°K.



The HgCdTe (commonly referred to as MCT or Mer-Cad) sensor material is a narrow direct bandgap zincblende.  MCT sensors are tuned to operate in wavelengths from 1Âµm all the way to 14Âµm. They are a versatile sensor material.  Unlike InSb sensors, MCT sensors produce cooled thermal camera systems that access both atmospheric transmission windows of 3Âµm to 5Âµm and 7Âµm to 14Âµm. Most people think of cooled cameras as always being MWIR (3Âµm-5Âµm).  MCT materials produce a cooled thermal camera that is MWIR or LWIR (7Âµm to 14Âµm).  MCT focal plane arrays also require cryogenic cooling to ~80Â°K.



Hot MCT is a relatively new technology utilizing Mer Cad based sensors.  The new âHOTâ sensors operate at warmer temperatures than the InSb and traditional HgCdTe chips. Instead of cooling to 80Â°K the HOT MCT only needs to be cooled to 160Â°K. In practical terms this greatly reduces the load on the cryo cooler. This creates a cooled thermal camera that starts up faster, has a longer cooler lifespan and uses less power.  This is fantastic for SWaP efforts.  The Hot MCT is a new development that is very promising but only time will tell if it proves to be the future of cooled thermal.



n conclusion, cooled thermal camera systems incorporate different sensor materials but offer distinct advantages when used in long range and ultra long range thermal imaging platforms. The key is the increased sensitivity and smaller lens sizes.  Next time, we will discuss lens options for your cooled thermal camera.

z1lCh_I6b3U,FLIR T1K Thermal Camera in HD,"The new FLIR T1K thermal camera brings high resolution imaging to the world of infrared. The fist imager in the T1K family is the FLIR T1020 thermal camera, engineered from the ground up to offer the best picture and most accurate measurements available in infrared today.

Built around a new thermal detector delivering a resolution of 1024 Ã 768, the FLIR T1K delivers more than twice the pixels of the nearest  FLIR camera. The detector is one of the most sensitive in the industry, sensing temperature differences as small as 0.02 C. Ensuring that all this resolution and sensitivity is put to good use, FLIR has engineered a new family of lenses that better capture infrared radiation. Together with a new processor, the lens and detector can more efficiently minimize interference from objects just outside the image. The resulting picture is both more accurate, as well as more brilliant and defined than previously possible.

In case 786k pixels just isn't enough, FLIR has included their UltraMax super resolution feature which can produce images of 3.1 MP. The T1K/T1020 takes 16 images in under a second, then these are later stitched together to form an image with four times the original data. And each pixel has full temperature data included for tremendous post processing and analysis opportunities. The FLIR T1K also includes the popular MSX digital/thermal enhancement. This combines just the outlines and patterns of visible imaging with the infrared image to provide a picture that looks more familiar, yet still includes all thermal data.",Ivy Tools,2015-09-18 21:23:41,1482,0,Science & Technology,"""Thermal Camera"""

The FLIR E5 thermal camera offers an excellent value in entry level infrared cameras. With more than twice the pixels of the E4 for just a few hundred dollars more, the E5 removes some of the graininess seen in lower resolution images. The E5 is great for routine electrical and mechanical scans, where overheating components may indicate wear and impending failure. Use it to scan electrical panels, switchgear, radiators, motors, and more.

The E5 includes a digital camera to capture the work area with each pull of the trigger, stored together with the thermal image. The new MSX image enhancement will even combine these two images in real time, with eye-popping results. See the detail of the visible image embossed right into the thermal image, with no loss of image quality as with other fusion images. The E5 can store up to 500 of these image sets in internal memory for later download to a computer.

With an imaging temperature range of -4 to 482 F, the FLIR E5 has you covered for most applications. The E5 can measure temperatures using a traditional center spot, or with a helpful area box which will automatically mark the hot and cold spot, even as you move the camera. The FLIR E5 kit includes the thermal camera, one battery, a USB cable for download, a copy of FLIR Tools analysis and reporting software, and a rugged hard carrying case.",Ivy Tools,2014-05-06 1:59:27,7224,0,Science & Technology,"""Thermal Camera"""

The Seek Thermal is an affordable, high-performance handheld thermal camera for your smartphone. It can be used to capture heat signatures and convert them into a real time picture, which is beneficial for many practical applications like pinpointing heat loss in home windows, discovering hidden leaks in pipes and more. It can also be used to allow you to spot people and animals in complete darkness, possibly for security purposes. The only problem is since it connects directly to your smartphone, the bright display of the phone can give away the users exact location. In an effort to avoid this, here is a simple DIY project to convert the Seek Thermal Camera into a thermal periscope using common GoPro and smartphone accessories. Now you can hide behind an object (e.g., wall, fence, rock) and maneuver the Seek Thermal Camera with a selfie stick to minimize disclosing your specific location.

Special thanks for Flir for sending me this tool for review.

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite diagnostic tools. I've used an inferred thermometer for years with pretty good results, but this tool is above and beyond that. Not only can it accurately tell me the temperature of an object, it can also give me a full color thermal image of it in real time. I call it, 'Predator vision'. I feel like I've only just scratched the surface of what this tool is capable of. Rest assured, you'll be seeing this in many upcoming ETCG repair videos.

C1ex66NwkMA,First impressions of FLIR Boson - the compact and inexpensive thermal camera by FLIR,"We  were so excited to get our hands on the FLIR boson prototypes by FLIR at the SPIE Expo in Baltimore Maryland recently.

So we are inside the S P I E defense and commercial sensing expo in Baltimore, Maryland, just 40 minutes from our headquarters.
And weâre now at the FLIR booth.  Weâre so excited to be here for the brand new thermal camera for UASâs and drones, the FLIR Boson. Like the FLIRâs quote, âmake something big with something smallâ, this camera is really small. As you can see here, today FLIR has 4 prototypes to show. So Boson is so small, it is just a quarter of the size of a FLIR Tau 2 or Vue Pro that everybody has been familiar with. It is even small than the FLIR Quark, a counterpart of FLIR Tau 2. Despite being this small or tiny, it is expected to have all the powerful performance and features of the flir Tau 2 and it has a shutter too to do FFC, just like the bigger siblings. Similarly, the Boson comes in two resolutions: 320 x 256 and 640 x 512. All of the four prototypes here are 320 with many different focal lengths, from short to long, or from wide to narrow field of view.
If you wonder where the name boson came from: boson is a type of physics particle that follows the Bose-Einstein statistics. Bose was a renown Indian physicist, who was in the same era with Einsteinâs. As you can see, FLIR loves physics particle names, such as Tau, Lepton, Quarkâ¦. So no wonder why they come up with Boson. Maybe theyâll come up with something called Fermion just to predict the future in a fun way.
What about the release dates: according to FLIR staff at the booth, the Boson 320 is expected to be released sometime in June or July 2016. The Boson 640 will come later, something like September or October 2016 or even longer.
Yes, the Boson is so small compared to the Tau 2 or Vue or Vue Pro, meaning there is much less power consumption. And it is super lightweight too. It weighs only about 7.5 grams according to the datasheet. So if that is true, it means it weighs only like 1/10th of the FLIR Vue PRO making it so ideal for drone usage. The lightweight means that we intelligentUAS can make a small gimbal for it, couple it with a powerful daylight camera or do other customizations. Less weight and less power consumption mean more flight time, which is what never stops being important.
The small size of the Boson is possible thanks to the new generation of thermal sensing pixel inside the camera. Itâs the 12 micron pixels as opposed to the 17 micron pixels in the FLIR Tau or Vue Pro. You can get more technical info from FLIR website or our own website at www.1uas.com
Now we start to wonder: boson it has all the feature of the Tau and has similar performance, what about the pricing? Well, pricing is another big surprise. Instead of costing much more than the Tau 2, it actually costs much LESS. The Boson 320 is expected to be in the range of under $1000 and the Boson 640 is expected to cost around only $2000.
The tiny FLIR boson is also packed with advanced thermal video processing technology inside. It allows advanced image processing, video analytics, peripheral sensor driversâ¦
We hope this has covered some useful info about the Boson in this first impression video. We are continuing to stay in touch with FLIR to bring more updates along the way as well as update about our development of accessories, and customization to fit the Boson on our thermal drone packages in the coming quarters. So please stay tuned and subscribe to our channels to keep yourselves updated. Thank you very much for watching and as always, have safe flights.",Intelligent UAS,2016-04-30 2:04:13,13515,6,Film & Animation,"""Thermal Camera"""

The British company Bullitt yesterday announced its new Cat S60 rugged smartphone, the worldâs first to feature a built-in thermal imaging camera. The product is essentially a fusion between Bullittâs Cat smartphones and FLIRâs thermal camera technology.

The phone has a 4.7-inch, super bright, 720p, Gorilla Glass screen and is rugged enough to survive drops from 1.8 meters (~5.9 feet) and swims to depths of 5 meters (~16.4 feet) for an hour.

On the back of the phone, youâll find 2 different camera modules: one is a standard 13-megapixel camera that shoots ordinary photos, and the other is a special FLIR-made thermal camera that provides a heat view of the world around you.

Watching two different engines warm up using a $40,000 Flir T1K thermal camera. The cold starts weâll be observing include a 2016 Subaru Crosstrek on the left, which has a 2 liter boxer four-cylinder engine, and a 2002 Honda S2000 on the right, which has a 2 liter inline-four cylinder engine.

All of the temperature data points, one through five, represent the exact same thing for each vehicle, measured in Celsius. Point one is the exterior temperature of the oil filter, point 2 is the heater core coolant line, point three is the top radiator hose, point four is the front of the engine block, and point five is the intake manifold, before the air is distributed to each of the cylinders. Both of the engines start at the exact same time, so you can compare these figures directly based on the time stamp shown on screen.

OQ3vv2V5rt0,Finding a sick kitty with my brand new CAT S60 Thermal Camera Phone,"My CAT S60 came in at the right moment - Monday 7th of November.

There's a family of stray cats in the flat yard, we've named the Mommy, Paillette, she's been there for a few years, and several neighbours, me included, take turns in feeding her... she's recently had a litter of 3 kittens... and they're quite a playful bunch... they have a big brother, sole survivor of a previous litter of 3 - six months old and he cares for them deeply...

Given how the other 2 kittens disappeared the last time, I built this new litter a small den - made of plastic bags(for waterproofing) taped to a cardboard box, that I've deposited beneath the bushes - Momma Paillette quickly understood the purpose of the shelter and she immediately adopted it... they stayed 3 weeks in it till the entrance was crushed by some heavy rain, and also by their own weight, cause they would climb and play with each other on top of it... and the entrance was crushed closed... but they were big enough by then to sleep in the bushes without worry...

Sadly Monday the 7th, two more weeks later, was the third day since WaÃ¯to, the smallest of the 3 new kittens, was seen to be very weak, his two young siblings would be running all over the place with the older sibling, prancing upon each other, and climbing up the bushes, but WaÃ¯to would just stay in the same place all day... he didn't even eat...

So I figured a trip to the veterinary was in order.... and poor WaÃ¯to was diagnosed with a severe gastric disorder and was given an injection while  I was given the task of administering him his antibiotics at night for 3 days... along with skimmed milk or chicken soup with a syringe a few times a day...

But night time came and WaÃ¯to was nowhere to be found... The other 4 cats were there, all over the place... but no sign of WaÃ¯to... not even a powerful flashlight could find him... but then a thought struck my mind, I had the ultimate tool in my pocket... my brand new phone that had arrived the very same afternoon ... I was so caught up with the VET thing that I barely had time to play with it... The little time I had with it went into restoring my apps  and contacts from my Google account...

So there it was, in my hand, the thermal camera... 20 seconds - that's how long it took me to sweep the yard and find a heat source right within the collapsed den... - but how did it get in there?  - A hole right at the top, torn into the plastic bag and into the cardboard below, and inside, was WaÃ¯to snuggled up into a corner and sleeping peacefully... Sadly it was time for the antibiotics though and I had to wake the poor thing up.

Praise the Almighty, after 3 days of treatment, WaÃ¯to is all well and kicking... despite him trying to run away and wriggling in my hands as if it was torture at every forced syringed meal... I ended up putting him in a sock with only his head sticking out - no more clawing...  I think he's now quite thankful that I insisted, cause of all the 5 cats, he's the only one to run to my feet and look up with a long Meeeeee every single time I'm around... and even if I don't have any food on me...


And if you guys want to see the cats with a normal camera, here they are, WaÃ¯to being the one that bites my hand while drinking the milk at the beginning... Big brother has a go first, then Mommy Paillette and then comes WaÃ¯to. The video is from before he got sick.

I2OBI0CSCJw,MWIR Thermal camera,"Cooled thermal camera systems are the clear choice for long range imaging. This is due to the highly sensitive FPA technology they employ. Typically, a cooled thermal camera will utilize either InSb or MCT sensor materials. These are very good materials for a thermal array in the 3-5 micron range. However, Focal Plane Arrays made from these materials do require cryogenic cooling in order to function at their peak performance level. That is why they are called âcooled thermal cameraâ systems. But, when these exotic sensor materials are combined with an appropriate cooling system, the result is a thermal imaging system that boasts MRTDâs on the order of 20mk or less. In practical terms this equates to 3-4 times the sensitivity of uncooled thermal camera systems. The sensitivity of cooled sensors, allows us to use much smaller lenses (f/4-f/5.5). It follows that, given a certain envelope of space, we can fit a much longer focal length lens into a cooled thermal camera design than any other technology would allow. When ultimate distance matters, long range cooled thermal camera systems are the only option.



http://www.x20.org/product/m7-ptz-long-range-thermal-imager/



Exotic materials are used to produce the focal plane array sensors that are used in cooled thermal cameras.  The most common are Indium Antimonide (InSb) and Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe).



The InSb (commonly referred to as Ins-Bee or reticulated insb) sensor material is a narrow gap semiconductor in crystaline form.  It is sensitive to wavelengths of 1Âµm to 5Âµm but is typically filtered, in cooled thermal camera systems, to 3Âµm to 5Âµm. InSb detectors have long been the leading choice for imaging systems that feature long range thermal optics.  It is a reliable and mature sensor technology that is manufactured in various countries around the world. The InSb detector does require cryogenic cooling to operate at peak efficiency and produce a usable thermal image. In the past ,this was accomplished by a dewar that needed to be filled with Liquid Nitrogen. The dewars are long gone. Now,highly efficient cryo coolers manage the task of cooling down to ~80Â°K.



The HgCdTe (commonly referred to as MCT or Mer-Cad) sensor material is a narrow direct bandgap zincblende.  MCT sensors are tuned to operate in wavelengths from 1Âµm all the way to 14Âµm. They are a versatile sensor material.  Unlike InSb sensors, MCT sensors produce cooled thermal camera systems that access both atmospheric transmission windows of 3Âµm to 5Âµm and 7Âµm to 14Âµm. Most people think of cooled cameras as always being MWIR (3Âµm-5Âµm).  MCT materials produce a cooled thermal camera that is MWIR or LWIR (7Âµm to 14Âµm).  MCT focal plane arrays also require cryogenic cooling to ~80Â°K.



Hot MCT is a relatively new technology utilizing Mer Cad based sensors.  The new âHOTâ sensors operate at warmer temperatures than the InSb and traditional HgCdTe chips. Instead of cooling to 80Â°K the HOT MCT only needs to be cooled to 160Â°K. In practical terms this greatly reduces the load on the cryo cooler. This creates a cooled thermal camera that starts up faster, has a longer cooler lifespan and uses less power.  This is fantastic for SWaP efforts.  The Hot MCT is a new development that is very promising but only time will tell if it proves to be the future of cooled thermal.



n conclusion, cooled thermal camera systems incorporate different sensor materials but offer distinct advantages when used in long range and ultra long range thermal imaging platforms. The key is the increased sensitivity and smaller lens sizes.  Next time, we will discuss lens options for your cooled thermal camera.

H4jePcPa7oM,MoviTHERM Injection Mold Monitoring with Thermal Camera,"Thermal video of automated injection mold monitoring using a FLIR thermal camera. The video shows MoviTHERM's automated thermal imaging system identifying failed mold cooling affecting four plastic parts. The parts coming out of the mold are too hot, which leads to either deformed parts or holes. Since the automated thermal inspection system has a dedicated alarm for each part, the pick and place robot can discard the failed parts individually.

4yCo-pE-tnA,FLIR ONE for iOS Thermal Imaging Camera Demo Video,"The long-awaited 2nd Generation FLIR ONE for iOS is here. Please see our unboxing video to see what's in the box.

This video is a quick overview of the features of the FLIR ONE for iOS thermal imaging camera. It requires an Apple device with a lightning connector. You can download the App for free iTunes.

This camera includes two sets of optics. One set is a standard visual camera, the other is the FLIR Lepton core. This gives you their exclusive MSX image enhancing technology for a fraction of what a traditional thermal camera would cost. It does have its limitations compared to the more robust thermal cameras from FLIR. This will put thermal technology within reach for a lot more people.

Thanks for joining us. Today, we're talking about the FLIR ONE for iOS. It comes with a nice, protective case. Use the lightning connector. You'll notice it has two cameras. One is a visual camera, and one is the Lepton core, or the thermal camera. Why it comes with two cameras on here we'll explain to you in a second. Again, lightning connector. You'll notice we had to take the cover off of this phone because of the fact that it has to sit flush. If you do have a cover, it's not going to be able to fit and get the connector in there. Again, you will have to take the cover off your phone. We've gone and already installed the FLIR ONE app. We go ahead and just turn it on. It's already turned on. Okay, great.
 You'll notice that it has a center spot reading, and you'll notice the outlining edges. That is because this uses something called MSX, which is a FLIR exclusive technology. It takes both the visual image and the thermal image and traces the visual and fills it in with the thermal. You'll see, as we move around, hot spots. You'll see our reflection right there as we go ahead and record this. Those aren't ghosts in the wall. You'll notice you can see even things like a socket or an outlet. If there's any heat going on behind that, you'd be able to see it thermally as well as visually.
 We have the features about the camera and the phone system. Go into settings. You can adjust your emissivity. It has a few different presets. You can change where you save it, change to save the photos. Automatically, it will calibrate, which is a new change from the older unit. The temperature units, you can change to celsius or fahrenheit.
 You can also use different modes. Here are the different color bands. You've got rainbow, lava. This is the hottest. Using what they call an isotherm, you can see the hottest point on the screen very easily. See how it turns red? There isn't anything really cold in here, so unfortunately, it's not going to show any cold, which would show up as a blue. You've got arctic, just a grayscale. You've got the iron, which is the standard way most people look at thermal images. You've got your high contrast, and you've got something called wheel. We're going to go back to iron mode.
 Other things you can do with this, you can record video. Putting it into video mode, hitting the record button, and now it's actually going to be recording a video as we take the shots. You can also put it in panoramic mode and take a panorama of a large environment. I'll stitch it together. You can see it in the portrait mode. For some reason, it blended out the color there, but we'll figure that out later. Then, it also has what's called time lapse mode. You can actually set it to record at certain intervals. In time lapse mode, you can set whether you're recording in seconds or minutes and up to 60 seconds or 60 minutes at a time. You can see how things change over.
 Again, here, we have the FLIR ONE. This is the iOS version. An Android version will be coming shortly, probably another two months. It's now July when we're making this video, so we'll make up a new one later on. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email or visit our website at tequipment.net. Thanks very much. Have a great day.",TEquipment.NET,2015-07-09 21:01:53,27534,14,Science & Technology,"""Thermal Camera"""

Once a shuttle was returned to its bay in the orbiter processing facility after landing, teams checked, refurbished or installed hardware for the flight ahead.

The shuttle then was towed to the nearby Vehicle Assembly Building, where it was joined to its tank and boosters. Finally, the completed launch vehicle and its mobile launcher platform rolled out to the launch pad atop a sturdy, slow-moving crawler-transporter. A spectacular liftoff was the reward for each processing flow, and upon landing, the sequence began once again.",David Arias,2014-08-06 7:35:22,1298,0,People & Blogs,"""Thermal Camera"""

The ideal solution to this problem is the application of thermal camera systems because the hot spots are significantly reflected on the thermal image (termogram) by contract colouring towards the surrounding. In most cases it is not possible or safe to approach the panels with a thermal camera either in the case that the panels are located on sloped roofs or cases where passing between the panels is prevented by various obstacles (plants, roughness of the terrain â¦). For these reasons, an elegant and efficient solution is the fixation of the Workswell WIRIS on the drone.",Workswell s.r.o.,2016-04-26 17:18:43,8092,1,People & Blogs,"""Thermal Camera"""

""It was a burglary in progress. Patrol officers responded to the location and set up a perimeter around the location. Officers saw the suspect attempt to flee out the back door but retreated when seeing the officers. Patrol officers believed that the suspects were barricaded. SWAT officers responded to the scene along with K-9. K-9 was sent in first and attempted to locate the suspects. K-9 was unsuccessfully. SWAT officers made entry to do a slow search. It was determined that the suspects were in the attic in the garage. The Tactical Electronics pole camera was used with the thermal head. As officers were checking the attic they were monitoring the temperature on the monitor. At one point the temperature was close the 98 degrees and believed it was a person behind some storage in the attic. Shortly after, we saw body movement and confirmed we had suspects in the attic. We saw one suspect move away from the attic entry and then fall through the sheet rock and placed into custody. The other suspect made it to the attic entry and was pulled down and placed into custody. While that suspect was crawling toward the attic entry we were able to watch his hands the entire time without officers having to go up in the attic and being exposed."" --Irving Texas SWAT",TacticalElectronics,2011-12-14 15:55:56,921,0,News & Politics,"""Thermal Camera"""

One way to stand guard or avoid people at night is to have thermal imaging. Its pricey but if you have the means and the need is strong enough, it could be worth every penny?

This is a video in Axis Communications' Academy Fundamentals educational series. This reference video is filmed with the AXIS Q1921-E and serves to show the difference between cameras using light to create an image and the thermal imaging camera.

Note how available ambient light is irrelevant and no shadows are cast. However, identifying anyone from these images is virtually impossible, even at high resolution. Identifying a walk or other significant personal features however is possible, but it requires a previous or simultaneous reference from ordinary video.

For other videos in this series showing the same scene in IR and white light, please take a look at the following links. Please note that field of view is a little different, but the videos are shot simultaneously.

""The hair stood on the back of my neck when I figured out it was watching us. Whatever it was was looking out behind that tree at us,"" said Stacy Brown, Sr.

The video was shot with a thermal camera in Torreya State Park. Brown, Jr. was skeptical until his own close encounter when he was on a hunt with a friend.

""We were asleep and we felt something push in the top of our tent. My buddy woke up screaming...I woke up and we heard it run off. That's when I went all in,"" said Brown, Jr.

Brown, Sr. said he had his doubts until shooting this footage. The family has spent thousands of dollars to buy equipment and try to go on hunts 10 days a month. Brown, Jr. has been all around the country on different hunts.

He even has a message for the doubters.

""Get out there and come with us, it'll change your mind I assure you,"" said Brown, Jr.

The Browns say they just released the footage because they got it verified by the show Finding Bigfoot.

nddR3R6bDeI,Review of FLIR E4 Thermal Camera Features,"http://www.ivytools.com/FLIR-E4-Infrared-Thermal-Imaging-Camera-63901-0101-p/flir-e4.htm

The FLIR E4 thermal camera is remarkable not only for its sub-$1000 price, but also because it offers such a good image for that price. While it has less resolution than it's Ex-Series siblings, the E4 nonetheless has a very usable 4,800 pixels. And it's sensitivity is also up to the job, detecting temperature changes as small as 0.1 C. The E4 is a great choice for detecting objects considerably warmer than their environment, such as hot electrical components, or motors and transmissions under operating conditions.

The rugged E4 housing is a rubberized plastic that is both tough and attractive. Well balanced and compact, the FLIR E4 still manages to boast a brilliant 3"" screen for clear viewing. Users will find the 45 degree wide angle lens perfect for capturing a broader, comparative view of an object without having to be so far away. And when temperature measurement is needed, the center spot can measure from -4 to 482 F.

The FLIR E4 thermal camera also includes a built-in digital camera which records a visible picture along with each thermal picture. These two images are paired for easy reporting later in the included FLIR Tools software. The two pictures can also be merged in real time to form one detail-rich image known as MSX. This image enhancement combines the detail of the visible image with the thermal data from the infrared image, resulting in a picture that showcases the thermal patterns you're looking for in an easy to understand setting. The MSX image of the E4 is so good, it might just change the way you think of thermal imaging.",Ivy Tools,2014-05-06 2:01:32,1529,1,Science & Technology,"""Thermal Camera"""

FLIR Brings New Generation Thermal Imager For Smartphones

Your phone can see in the dark and measure heat with this attachment

The Flir One is a tiny, powerful infrared camera

The highlight of the FLIR One accessory is that it transforms a mobile device to into a thermal imager that with infrared can
show heat images and measures temperature

The FLIR One can be attached to the Micro-USB connector for Android or to a Lightning connector for iOS devices.

The new FLIR One is powered by an internal battery and features a Lepton thermal camera core, which is four times the resolution of the previous version.

It also automatically adjusts itself, and produces higher resolution images than the first model.

An app accompanies the Flir One 2015 and opens up the creative aspect of the camera.

There are various color palette options, the chance to capture still images, and several modes including timelapse, macro, and panorama shots. Pictures taken with the Flir One 2015 can be shared on social networks through the app.

This is only the start of the Flir One 2015âs capabilities, and the company has produced a software development kit for developers, so we will hopefully see other apps using its ability in the future.

The company claims that the FLIR One can show temperature variations of less than a tenth of a degree.

""The technology enables a host of practical applications, from identifying energy inefficiencies and water leaks in a home, to enabling safe and enjoyable outdoor exploration,"" adds FLIR.

Teenager Designs World's Fastest Consumer Drone

Is this the smartest drone yet? UAV that travels at more than 70mph has a supercomputer that lets it fly unaided

The Teal quad drone can travel up to 40 mph in windy conditions.
It will be available at Christmas and will cost $1,299.
Removable top section and arms could be replaced with second camera.

From striking aerial photography to monitoring hard to reach areas as part of search and rescue missions, the list of tasks that drones can do is ever growing.

While most drones require a driver to control their movements from the ground, one new model can fly itself unaided.

The Teal quad drone contains a supercomputer which allows it to fly autonomously as well as recognise images.


The Teal quad is the brainchild of founder George Matus, who at only 18 years old, wanted to create a device that was 'fast, versatile, smart and break the limits of what drones could do.'

Mr Matus told MailOnline: 'In regards to flight speed, it depends on the environment, altitude, wind, and battery life, so we say 70+mph to cover all of that.'

While this high speed could be seen as dangerous, on its website Teal states.

Teal is built on both the hardware side and software side to make it as safe and easy as possible to fly, while still allowing mind-blowing manoeuvrability and speed.

One of the most interesting features is an inbuilt mini 'supercomputer' called the Nvidia TX1, similar to Raspberry Pi.
This allows the drone to fly autonomously, recognise images, and even handle learning.
The modular design of the drone means that the arms can be taken on and off, as well as the top section of the drone.
In the future this could allow owners to attach specialised arms for different functions.


Mr Matus said: 'We're going to have a top cover with a camera port in it, so someone could install a thermal camera and use the Teal in search-and-rescue operations, or install or attach a laser scanner and use it for surveying.

'Or they could install different types of rotors for racing or carrying bigger payloads.

The device can be controlled by an iOS or Android phone, or even a radio controller, and contains a 13 mega-pixel camera.

The company hopes that the combination of modular design, and powerful supercomputer will make the drone appealing for both consumer and commercial uses.

The drone will be available from Christmas 2016, though at $1,299 (Â£985), it is not an investment to take lightly.

ribiDIkEv_s,107 Hogs Down | Hog Hunting with Thermal Night Vision in Texas | Zeus Pro 640,"Hog hunting with Thermal Night Vision. Texas farms have been completely devastated by feral hogs and the problem is only getting worse. A farmer fights back using his Sig 716 308 AR-10 and the Armasight Zeus Pro 640 50mm Thermal Scope.

This video shows footage of thermal imaging technology being utilized for the purpose of feral hog eradication.

Feral swine are a non-native and invasive species in Texas. Each year hogs cause millions of dollars in damage in the form of damaged crops, contaminated water supplies, broken equipment, transmission of disease and injury to livestock.

Feral hogs compete with native wildlife for resources and also prey directly on the eggs and young of ground nesting birds and will actively hunt small mammals, frogs, lizards and snakes. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/operational-activities/feral-swine/feral-swine-damage/feral-swine-natural-resource-damage

Due to their intelligence, adaptability, and prolific breeding habits, traditional methods of hunting and trapping have been largely ineffective in reducing the feral hog population. The introduction of night vision and thermal optics has greatly increased landowners' ability to mitigate the destruction caused by feral hogs.

Feral swine are not considered game animals in Texas and may be hunted by any means or methods at any time of year.

MwhqdVICTA0,Prague live camera with dynamic overlay graphics,"About project
The aim of this project was to introduce the possibilities of the new ACAP CamOverlay app (https://camoverlay.com) on an attractive picture of HradÄany in Prague and, thus, provide the viewers in an attractive way with information regarding Prague sights, in the form of embedded dynamic graphics, and also to show the birth of the new advertising media which does not require any expensive equipment for its functionality.

Technical solution
To solve this project, we have selected the AXIS P5624-E MKII (https://www.axis.com/cz/cs/products/axis-p5624-e) IP camera which, due to its PTZ function, enables the scanned image to move on a precisely defined route and time and creates an attractive view of the Prague sights for the viewer. In addition, the high-resolution image, great picture even in poor lighting conditions and large zoom underline the beauty of HradÄany in Prague even more.

Displaying the information by embedding the graphics was achieved by the ACAP CamOverlay app (https://camoverlay.com) which can add your own graphics to each camera PTZ position. With the âCaruselâ function, more graphics at each PTZ position can be changed, with setting the time for each piece of displayed information. The app also enables to display the display of two mutually independent graphics. The second piece of added information in this project is the weather forecast via the Wounderground service.

To create a stable stream on the YouTube Live platform, we used another ACAP CamStreamer app (https://camstreamer.com) which, besides creating the quality image stream, also underlines the scene by an attached MP3 audio file.

CamOverlay app is now supported by 30 Axis camera models. AXIS M2025-LE, M3105-L, M3105-LVE, P1364, P1364-E, P1365 Mk II, P1365-E Mk II, P1405-LE Mk II, P1425-LE Mk II, P1435-LE, P5514, P5514-E, P5515, P5515-E, P5624-E Mk II, P5635-E Mk II, Q1775, Q1755-E, Q1941-E, Q1942-E, Q3615-VE, Q3617-VE, Q6052, Q6052-E, Q6054, Q6054-E, Q6055, Q6055-C, Q6055-E, Q6155-E",CamStreamer,2017-05-10 10:07:31,90898,30,Entertainment,"""Thermal Camera"""

I had some inquiries about the data logger I used here.  Im not paid by these folks in any way.

Quick summary is pricey, but gets the job done!

The device is called a 'labquest2'
https://www.vernier.com/products/interfaces/labq2/
its kinda a stand alone version of the pi but but is a lot more user friendly.  It will datalog up to 4 detectors at the time.

it can also be used with a good range of detectors (which was the main selling point for me)
https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/

They are all pricey, but the functionality is pretty good.  I looked at a whole range of gas detectors before settling on this one.  Most were related to flue gas or exhaust testing.  Most dont 'measure' everything, they will detect oxygen, and calculated CO2 from the O2 drop.
For me I wanted direct measures of CO2 and O2, so the vernier worked out okay.  The response time on the CO2 detector is lousy (minutes).  Accurate calibration was also not straight forward.  It just assumes background is 400ppm for air.  If however its not (bear in mind the meter takes 15 mins to equilibrate), thats essentially the % error on the other measurements.
I found the best way for accurate measurements was simply to create your own CO2 standards and do your own calibration.
The O2 meter is fast responding, but requires its own care (needs to be kept upright).
I had some dealings with their customer support about the functionality of their detectors.  They responded quickly and in detail.
I wanted to know if I could use their ethanol meter to measure my blood alcohol by exhaled breath.  They gave me the honest answer which was 'kinda' but they were fuzzy on the details about the response of the meter to different humidities and temperatures.  That still shows they are aware of the limits of their machines and are not simply BS 'ours is the best' salesmen.",Thunderf00t,2017-06-27 7:45:06,413192,671,Entertainment,"""Thermal Camera"""

. Remove the IR lens. Its not as difficult as you'd think. To do so, carefully disassemble the camera until you have the lens assembly visible, depending on the camera model you may or may not be able to remove the IR filter which will look like a red tinted piece of glass. Use tweezers to remove it. This should fix it.

Here's a surprisingly powerful and effective spy camera and camcorder. Depending on what you already have at your disposal this could only cost you around $40.

Iâve picked out some rotors with directional vanes, rather than straight vanes, which supposedly offer better cooling as they help pump air through the brakes, which leads to less brake fade. Iâll be doing some testing to see if this is actually true in a later video.

Our first step in changing out the brakes is to loosen the wheel lug nuts. Next, we need to lift the wheels off the ground. Be sure to locate the proper jacking points in your owners manual before lifting the car. With the car raised, we can remove the wheels and access the brakes.Starting at the front, first we need to remove the brake caliper to get access to the rotor. To remove the caliper piston & brake pads, there are two bolts on the backside of the caliper. Use a wrench to hold the caliper pin in place, while using a socket wrench to remove the bolts. After removing these two bolts, you can pull the caliper free - set it aside and be sure not to let it hang from the brake line. You can now also remove the two brake pads.

Next, weâll remove the caliper bracket. There are two screws to remove, and then it can be pulled free. With complete access, now we can start removing the brake rotor. Usually there are two screws which hold it in, which if theyâre old will likely be rusted at this point. Using a screwdriver and a mallet or hammer, give the rusted screws several hammer taps to help disturb the rust. Then, using a screwdriver, or perhaps an impact wrench if needed, remove the two screws. If nothing seems to get them to budge, you can simply drill out the screws so theyâre no longer fastening the rotor.

At this point, the rotor is free to remove, but itâs likely that rust will hold it in place. There are two bolt holes to break it from the rust. Using the bolts from the caliper, screw them into the rotor, and slowly tighten each bolt, alternating back and forth, until the rotor finally breaks away.

Before installing the new rotor, spray both sides with brake cleaner to remove any protective oil or residue that may be left on the surface. On the hub where the brake rotor rests, rust can build up, so Iâm using a wire brush on a drill bit to remove some of the rust and clean up the hub a bit. Slide the new rotor in place, aligning the orientation with the screw holes. You can use a single lug nut to hold the rotor in place while you assemble the brake caliper.

Next weâll put the brake caliper bracket back in place using the two bolts. Hondaâs torque spec for these bolts is 79.6 lb-ft. (108 N-m). With the new brake pads, Honda recommends applying Molykote M77 or Daikalub 528D to the back and sides of the backing plate, as well as on the back of the shims. If your pads came with new hardware, replace the clips in caliper bracket, and then slide the brake pads in place. Make sure not to get any grease on the rotors or pad face.

Now we need to push the piston back into the caliper. Before doing so, itâs a good idea to wipe down the surface & exposed sides of the piston. Then place the old brake pad against the piston, and using a brake pad piston compressor, press the piston back into place. It shouldnât require much effort, and once the effort gets high, the piston is likely flush with the caliper and you can stop. I bought this tool for $8 from Harbor Freight, and it works just fine.

Next, be sure the brake caliper pins are lubricated and can rotate freely. Itâs a good idea to inspect these and apply grease as necessary. Slide the caliper over the brake pads, and torque down the two bolts to 24 lb-ft (32 N-m). Now we can put the wheel back on, and tighten down the lug nuts. Because the car is lifted, weâll need to wait until itâs lowered again to apply the correct torque.

How to blow 100 MILLION dollars as a creationist?

Honestly, this makes solar roadways look like a thoughtful and well planned use of money!

looks like the Ark Encounter will get significantly less than its projected minimum.  It had a lower bound of 1.5mn, and it looks like they will be lucky to break the million mark.  Further, if the slowly declining attendance of AiGs 'Creationist Museum' is anything to go by, they build the Ark Encounter at EXACTLY the wrong time!

WBQlK89PyxQ,How Every Single Modern Subaru AWD System Works,"How All Four Of Subaru's AWD Systems Work
What's The Best AWD System - https://youtu.be/jm-_Ncjunuc
Subscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7

Subaru currently has four different AWD systems:
1. Viscous Coupling Center Differential AWD
2. Active Torque Split AWD
3. Variable Torque Distribution AWD
4. Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD) AWD

Descriptions Below From The Following Link:
https://www.subaru.ca/WebPage.aspx?WebSiteID=282&WebPageID=5964

1. Viscous Coupling Center Differential AWD
""This system is used for all models equipped with manual transmissions, excluding the WRX STI. It delivers the sporty satisfaction of quick shifts combined with an AWD system that makes the most of the available traction at all times. This system also features an efficient layout with a viscous-coupling limited slip centre differential that maintains a 50/50 front/rear torque split for optimum torque distribution, near neutral handling and surefooted performance.""

2. Active Torque Split AWD
""This system employs a multi-plate transfer clutch that maintains a 60/40 front/rear torque split and uses a range of sensors to automatically adjust this split on-the-fly as conditions warrant, creating more predictable handling. The system that's linked to all Subaru models (excluding WRX) equipped with the LineartronicÂ® Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), the Active Torque Split AWD places the focus on ease of operation, fuel efficiency and reliability.""

3. Variable Torque Distribution AWD
""Linked to the Sport LineartronicÂ® CVT and exclusive to the WRX, this AWD system delivers sportier performance and superior efficiency all at once. The centre differential adjusts front/rear torque split from 45/55 in normal conditions (for a sportier rear-biased feel) up to 50/50 when the weather worsens or the road conditions deteriorate (for maximum traction). The viscous self-locking rear differential maintains stability when more torque is sent to the rear wheels, ensuring the perfect balance of control and fun.""

4. Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD) AWD
""As it's a purebred high-performance car, it follows that the Subaru WRX STI would feature the ultimate in high-performance AWD systems. The DCCD allows the driver to adjust the centre differential locking (through one manual and three automatic modes), varying the torque split from 41/59 front/rear to 50/50 to suit the mood and the conditions. The AWD system also includes a helical-type front differential and a TORSENÂ® rear differential, creating a triple-differential set-up that is completely unique in the industry.""

Arac4wzQRKw,QuickPlay Demonstration of FPGA-based Vision Acceleration,"For more information about embedded vision, including hundreds of additional videos, please visit http://www.embedded-vision.com.

Stephane Hauradou, Co-founder of QuickPlay, demonstrates the company's latest embedded vision technologies and products at the May 2016 Embedded Vision Summit. Specifically, Hauradou demonstrates how the QuickPlay FPGA development platform was used to build a FPGA-based vision accelerator from scratch. The demo consisted in a 10GigE Vision camera pushing 10G video data into a Xilinx Kintex UltraScale-based FPGA card and the video data being processed in real-time inside the FPGA where a color separation filter, IP from partner Auviz Systems, was applied to the video stream before being sent to the server for display. Like QuickPlay, Auviz Systems and Xilinx are also Embedded Vision Alliance member companies.",Embedded Vision Alliance,2016-05-24 23:34:50,175,0,Science & Technology,"""Thermal Camera"""
dyEYaN6Y_FM,5 Things You Should Never Do In A Turbocharged Vehicle,"5 Things You Should Never Do In A Turbocharged Car
5 Things You Should Never Do Playlist - https://goo.gl/SxoUi7
Subscribe for new videos every Wednesday! - https://goo.gl/VZstk7

1. Do not run the engine hard after start-up.
Most people know you should let your engine warm up before running it hard, but many cars only have coolant gauges. Engine oil tends to take longer to heat up, because you donât have a thermostat like the coolant does, which isolates the coolant in the engine block and regulates its temperature. Oil that isnât heated up wonât flow as fast as oil at operating condition, which means youâll have less protection at engine start up. This is especially true for turbocharged vehicles, because you also have oil feeding the bearings of the turbocharger, which spins at insanely high RPM and produces significant heat, so you want to make sure you have proper oil flow through the turbo.
It will be different for every car, but it could be an additional several minutes before your oil temperature is near your engine coolant temperature.

2. Don't shut the car off immediately after running it hard.
Youâre going to have hot spots where the engine components, and especially the turbocharger, are still significantly hotter than your engine oil temperature. If you shut off the engine, the oil no longer flows, and thus pockets of the oil are going to be heated up to very high temperatures. These high temperatures break down the oil, and also burn up and evaporate the light end of the oil, leaving behind a heavier oil that wonât have ideal flow characteristics. This reduces your engine oil life, and also means you might have less protection at start-up.

3. Donât lug the engine. Low Engine Speed, High Load Operations. First, this isnât ideal because youâre telling your engine to move your vehicle quickly when itâs at a huge gearing disadvantage. Second, when your engine tries to produce more power at low engine speeds, it may be able to inject more fuel, but not ingest enough air. As a result, youâll have a highly rich mixture and this can lead to poor emissions, damaging your catalytic converter, and seeing black smoke come out your exhaust. Third, regarding damaging your engine, this can cause low speed pre-ignition. LSPI is a when you have pre-ignition of your air fuel mixture (before your spark ignites it) and is becoming a more common phenomenon with small turbocharged engines running at low engine speeds with high load. Itâs a dangerous condition that can cause engine damage, such as broken spark plugs or cracked pistons, as a result of extremely high pressures which occur due to significantly advanced ignition timing. Itâs also very challenging to detect, and canât be avoided through ignition timing or changing the spark plugâs heat range.

4. Don't use low octane rating fuel, especially if the car has been modified. Turbocharged cars tend to have higher pressures and temperatures within the combustion chamber, which is why they have reduced compression ratios to compensate. If your car is modified, you can keep it reliable by running a rich mixture and using high quality, high octane fuels. Obviously reducing boost and retarding the engine timing will do this as well, but of course youâll be reducing performance. There are knock sensors to help minimize any engine problems, and so theyâll retard timing if it senses knock will occur.

5. Donât floor it coming out of a corner.
In this one I just wanted an excuse to talk about slip angles. Turbocharged cars have some varying amount of turbo lag, new ones are much better. My point is this, as youâre coming out of a corner, your tires have some loading on them, whether your car is FWD, RWD, whatever. Now this doesnât apply to AWD quite as much, but itâs still an issue. Your carâs stability is a result of your front tire slip angles being nearly identical to your rear tires slip angles. So long as this is true, your car moves on its targeted path. If you floor a turbocharged car, especially cars with high amounts of turbo lag, you get slammed with torque fairly surprisingly. This shock of torque increases the demand of the driven tires, increasing their slip angle. If you have a significant increase of slip angle of just one set of tires, front or rear, you end up with understeer for FWD, or oversteer for RWD. All of this is to say that your throttle application exiting the corner is very important, especially in 2WD turbo vehicles, where turbo lag can easily cause an understeer or oversteer situation.

hTfJCUJEkfM,Ghost Team (Trailer),"Louis is a regular guy. He runs a small print-and-copy shop in a Long Island strip mall. He drinks beer with his best buddy, Stan. He hunts for evidence that ghosts exist. Believe it or not, Louis is normal, one of many thousands of people who consider themselves amateur ghost hunters. Itâs an escape from the drudgery of his daily routine and a reminder that there may be more to life than he knows. When a customer walks into his print shop and mentions possible paranormal activity at an abandoned farm outside of town, Louis sees a chance to finally indulge his hobby for real. With the help of his depressed best friend, a screw-up nephew, an overly vigilant mall cop, a hack cable-access psychic, a whip-smart beautician and a van filled with amateur equipment, Louis is determined to catch some ghosts on film. But poltergeists are the least of what the team finds in the abandoned McIntosh estate. What begins as a bumbling attempt to explore the farm soon becomes a hilarious and terrifying race to escape it alive.",The Orchard Movies,2016-08-29 12:00:01,850,0,,"""Thermal Camera"""
