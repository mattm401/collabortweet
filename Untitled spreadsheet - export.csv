Manfrotto tripod sponserd by: http://www.slach.at/


The British company Bullitt yesterday announced its new Cat S60 rugged smartphone, the worldâ€™s first to feature a built-in thermal imaging camera. The product is essentially a fusion between Bullittâ€™s Cat smartphones and FLIRâ€™s thermal camera technology.

The phone has a 4.7-inch, super bright, 720p, Gorilla Glass screen and is rugged enough to survive drops from 1.8 meters (~5.9 feet) and swims to depths of 5 meters (~16.4 feet) for an hour.

On the back of the phone, youâ€™ll find 2 different camera modules: one is a standard 13-megapixel camera that shoots ordinary photos, and the other is a special FLIR-made thermal camera that provides a heat view of the world around you.

vNEaRvUTj3M,Ryobi Phone Works ES2000 Infrared Thermometer,"Check out the Ryobi ES2000 IR Thermometer here -- https://www.ryobitools.com/power-tools/products/details/647

Ryobi just released the brand new lineup of Phone Works tools....which are a totally new kind of tools that work directly with you iPhone or Android & can save real time data so you wont lose track of the various projects you are working on.

The ES2000 is the Infrared Thermometer, and not only can it take live temperature readings, it also uses the phone's camera to have a live video feed for you to watch & take screenshots of when you want to keep track of things or email/text/upload pics to your contractor so they know exactly what is going on & what you are talking about.

The mount that they have as part of the unit even has a 1/4-20 tripod mount threaded into the bottom, so if you are wanting to have very precise or continuous readings, you can use the IR thermometer literally ""hands-free"" while you work.

Here are some quick specs on the ES2000 :

- Measures temps ranging from -22F - 622F
- Reads both Celsius & Fahrenheit
- 1 yr warranty
- Works on iPhone & Android (verify your phone compatibility on the Phone Works website)
- Capture High Definition images that you can save/email/upload/share

Here are a few pointers that I can tell you from using the ES2000 :

- The closer you are to the object being measured, the more accurate the reading (ALL infrared thermometers are this way)
- Be sure to turn your headphone volume to MAX!  (this is how the ES2000 communicates with your phone)
- Hold your phone & not the mount....that way you wont accidentally drop your phone and break it

The entire Phone Works lineup is very impressive, so keep your eye out for more videos from us about the rest of what they have available!",Real Tool Reviews

MAwI6m7az2s,[W40] Marco Nardecchia: Flavour Anomalies and Lepton Flavour Universality,"Title: Flavour Anomalies and Lepton Flavour Universality
Speaker: Marco Nardecchia (CERN)
Host: Nicolas Bernal

Abstract: In this work I will review the status of various experimental results in flavour physics that are in tension with the Standard Model predictions. In particular I will discuss very recent LCHb results aiming at testing the universality of SM interactions in the lepton sector. In the second part of the talk I will present a model independent interpretation of the data i terms of New Physics, and I will discuss also some explicit models.

CiTLrRb9P1I,Getting Started In Infrared Photography,"In this video I give an overview and introduction to Infrared Photography for those who have had no experience with it. In the video, I talk about the three most common ways one can take infrared images:

1.) Purchase a camera specifically made for infrared photography
2.) Put a filter on your lens that only allows infrared light to pass through to the camera's sensor.
3.) Have a normal camera converted to infrared or purchase one that was already converted.

Next I explain my choice and why I chose to go that route then I explain the different frequency choices one has for infrared photography. Finally, I process an infrared image demoing what is needed to do in Photoshop to achieve the ""Infrared Look"".

For a primer on infrared photography, visit this website:

For post processing, look here:

The Zenmuse XT camera should be a boon for tasks like spotting fires, search and rescue and measuring the thermal efficiency of homes. The drone company is already by far the most popular for cinematographers and hobbyists, but DJI has lately been targeting industrial operations, having recently launched a pesticide-spraying model. The infrared camera could also help farmers monitor crop growth, and would be useful for folks like police, firefighters and building inspectors.

Watching two different engines warm up using a $40,000 Flir T1K thermal camera. The cold starts weâ€™ll be observing include a 2016 Subaru Crosstrek on the left, which has a 2 liter boxer four-cylinder engine, and a 2002 Honda S2000 on the right, which has a 2 liter inline-four cylinder engine.

All of the temperature data points, one through five, represent the exact same thing for each vehicle, measured in Celsius. Point one is the exterior temperature of the oil filter, point 2 is the heater core coolant line, point three is the top radiator hose, point four is the front of the engine block, and point five is the intake manifold, before the air is distributed to each of the cylinders. Both of the engines start at the exact same time, so you can compare these figures directly based on the time stamp shown on screen.

On the right of each of the thermal images is a sliding scale, which adapts to the image and shows the temperature range on screen. The bottom number, in Celsius, and wherever there are dark spots, represents the coldest area. The top number, and wherever there are white spots, represents the hottest area.

Beneath their respective videos, we also have the air intake temperature, coolant temperature, and engine RPM read directly from the vehicle. For the duration of the video, the temperature of the ambient air around the car remained at about 7 degrees Celsius.
Finally, Iâ€™ve added a plot in the bottom right corner showing oil temperature with respect to time. This temperature comes from a thermal probe inserted down each of the vehicles dipstick tubes.

By this point, you can start to see that the intake manifold temperatures, point number 5, differ for each. The Crosstrek has a plastic manifold, elevated away from the engine, which does a better job of keeping intake temperatures down versus the aluminum manifold of the Honda, which is tucked within the engine bay and close to heat sources. By the end of the video, the Subaru has over a 20 degree advantage in intake temperatures versus the Honda, and yes, both of them are still pulling in the exact same 7 degree ambient air.

EMISSIVITY NOTE: For anyone concerned about emissivity and the temperatures you're witnessing, I just did a quick test in my kitchen to verify the temps we're seeing. I took a sheet of paper (emissivity ~0.9+) and a sheet of aluminum foil (emissivity ~0.05), while the camera was set for an emissivity of 0.95. The camera accurately read the temperature of both items (about 20 deg C). Then I switched the camera's emissivity to 0.04. The aluminum foil's temp then varied widely, from 0 deg C to 50 deg C (it was still at 20 deg C, the temperature inside my home), while the sheet of paper now incorrectly read 30 deg C. To me, this shows that with the camera set at 0.95 for emissivity, readings will be accurate, and it has a way of calibrating for various emissivity coefficients of what's in view. This video was recorded with emissivity set at 0.95.

iL8Sq1SQKRM,"CAT S60 review - FLIR thermal Camera sample, performance, battery performance","Here is the CAT S60 review, this handset is available in India, it is pricey but a lot different from the others smartphones. S60 is world's first smartphone to feature a built in FLIR Thermal Camera.

CAT S60 unboxing
The box pack is yellow color, and inside you will get the handset, a screen guard, user manual, warranty information booklet, data cable and travel charger 5V/2A. Earphone is not included. SAR value as mentioned on the box 0.854 W/kg@1g Head and  0.557 W/kg@1g body.

#CATS60 Design, Display and OS
The S60 is a rugged smartphone and like other rugged smartphone this one is made to survive falls and hence has extra layer of protection. The frame that is being used is made of die-cast steel frame - it is really tough almost impossible to bend.

The overall protection makes the handset feel quite bulky but the weight is quite acceptable. Weight with battery is 223 grams and thickness is 12.66mm. The handset is so tough (rugged) that it will survive a drop from 6 feet (condition that the screen should not get a direct / pointed hit - example a sharp object hit to screen, in that case the screen will break but handset will survive).

This is a dual SIM handset with 4G LTE support however VoLTE support is missing, you can use Jio4GVoice to make calls using Reliance Jio SIM. There are dual nano SIM slots and a separate micro SD card slot that can use 128GB external cards.

There is LED notification and good number of sensors - accelerometer, proximity, light, gyro, magnetic and pressure.
S60 sports a 4.7 inch screen with HD resolution. Color reproduction, viewing angles and touch response are very good. The screen also comes with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection. Do note that though Gorilla Glass 4 is tough it is breakable.
Android Marshmallow version 6.0 runs out of the box.

CAT S60 Memory and Storage
The CAT S60 is packed with 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage.

CAT S60 Performance
This handset is using well known Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 MSM8952 octa core processor @ 1.5GHz coupled with Adreno 405 GPU. Performance was smooth, lag free and max battery temperature I encountered was 43 degrees.

CAT S60 Benchmark
Quadrant : 22099
AnTuTu : 45369 / 7487
Nenamark 2 : 60 fps
Disk Speed :  145 MB/s read / 71 MB/s write
Multi Touch : 10 point

CAT S60 Gaming

Hardware is powerful and it easily played Modern Combat 5 and Asphalt 8 in high quality mode without any lags.

CAT S60 Camera

There is  13MP camera on the rear and 5MP on the front. Camera quality is below average not really that good, captures okay quality images in daylight and hardly anything in low light. FHD video can be recorded and video quality is decent.

Camera Rating 2.5 out of 5

CAT S60 FLIR Thermal Camera

This is something unique and no other smartphone comes equipped with.  The #FLIR Thermal Camera can detect heat signature and gives you a different view of the surrounding. Basically using a Thermal Camera you can easily know the Heat source and you can also use this in complete dark Environment.
The Thermal Camera can be used to know the area on a laptop / smartphone that is heating up, to detect leakages, to detect heat source and also to detect movements for security purpose. The thermal camera interface comes with some filter and you can capture still thermal shots or even record thermal videos.

Others

The CAT S60 comes with a dedicated button that can be programmed and a SOS button too. You need to assign contact numbers. During an emergency press the SOS button and an SMS with your location will be sent to your pre-defined contacts.

Waterproof

This S60 handset can survive up to 5 meter depth for 60 minutes. There are special switch with 2M/5M markings near the speaker vents on front face bottom and top (Check video review). You need to use the appropriate switch when using handset under water. The handset can record underwater videos.

The 5M switch will seal off the speaker vents as they could get damaged at 5M pressure. There is  a speaker dry app that you can use in case for some reason water enters the speaker vent.


CAT S60 Battery

The S60 houses a 3800 mAh non-removable battery with quick charge 2.0 support. On a full charge you can expect 4 to 6 hours of non-stop moderate to heavy usage. It will give you an easy 1 day of mixed usage.

CAT S60 Battery Performance

â€¢ Running Benchmark app â€“ 10 minutes / 5% /  35 degree
â€¢ Asphalt 8 + MC5 game play â€“ 29 minutes / 11% / 43 degree
â€¢ FHD video play back - 24 minutes / 6% / 37 degree

It took me 2 hours 45 minutes to charge the handset from 0% to 100% using wall charger.

Verdict

Now if this thermal camera can be of any use in your business or profession then you can think of buying this handset, thermal technology is not cheap. However if thermal camera is of no use then makes no sense.

Rating 4.2 out of 5

CAT S60 price is Rs. 64,999.

In this video we give you guys an in depth overview of the Armasight Zeus Thermal Optic lineup. These optics are simply amazing, and with that commands a premium over other standard optical devices.

A quick note guys, some of the footage may appear to be lacking in contrast but when you are out in the 100Â° F Georgia heat filming this video it doesn't help matters. With a cooler background, such as in a nighttime scenario, the contrast between subject and background would be far greater and easier to distinguish.

We hope you enjoy this fun look at Thermal technology, and be on the lookout for more footage filmed using these optics in other videos as well as overviews of other thermal units and night vision devices in the future.

Qnd1HalzWyw,Locate A Honey Bee Hive With A FLIR ONE Thermal Camera for ios,"I bought a FLIR ONE camera for Iphone 6 a couple of months ago and I've used it on several hive location and removal jobs where the exact location of the hive was difficult to determine.  It works really good and has prevented a lot of unnecessary tear of building materials.  It is best to use it early in the morning before the sun heats everything up since it picks up on temperature contrasts.  I even used it to locate a plumbing leak in a concrete slab.

8mdxXJ1et_o,Basics of Infrared Heating,"Even though infrared heating technology has been around for decades, it's still a relatively unknown concept in the HVAC industry. Infrared heating is similar to the sun in that it gently warms people, floors, and objects. As a result, these objects retain and re-radiant heat back into the space and not up to the ceiling or out the door like air heaters do. This translates into greater comfort and energy savings. Even the premier HVAC trade association, the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), recognizes these facts and has recommended reducing building heat lossesÂ by fifteen to twenty percent when using infrared equipment.Â
How is this accomplished? Infrared heat is part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The wavelength defined as infrared, is the portion of the spectrum, just beyond the visible red light.
Infrared heating utilizes all methods of heat transfer - radiation, convection, conduction, and absorption, most important of these is radiation. Our heaters radiate infrared radiation. This is the transfer of energy in wave form from a hot surface to relatively cooler surfaceÂ without any means of heat transfer, such as air. It is a direct transfer of energy. The ability of an object to absorb infrared energy is also very important. Most materials within a building, such as concrete,Â metals, and water are highlyÂ absorptive. Therefore, making it ideal for heating with infrared. Conduction is the transfer of heat through a solid object. This allows the building to heat evenly by spreading the heat throughout objects and warming the air throughÂ convective energy from these warmed objects. These concepts combined cause the heating dynamics of a building to be different. The heat loss to obtain equivalent comfort is less. Therefore allowing the user of infrared heater to use less energy and install less heating capacity.Â
Infrared heating systems consist of a burner, heat exchanger tube, and reflector. A flame is ignited. That flame is drawn down a highly emissive tube by a fan or pump and then a geometrically designed reflector directs heat down toward the floor.Â
Easy to install, maintain, and operate. Infrared heating is clean, quiet and draft-free making it ideal for large spaces like warehouses, manufacturing areas, transportation facilities, airplane hangers and many more. Infrared heating is a win, win, win for building owners, occupants and installers alike. Roberts Gordon invented the first gas-fired low-intensity infrared heater and remains the leader today with the most efficient robust product offering in the industry.",Roberts Gordon

OHXZtDkw_Rk,How is an Infrared Grill Different,"The Char-BroilÂ® TRU-Infraredâ„¢ Difference:

The science behind TRU-Infrared tells a juicy story. Unlike traditional gas grills that use convective heat (hot air) to cook food, Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared grills limit the hot air flow and use natural, radiant heat to cook food directly without drying. While convective heat destroys food's moisture barrier, infrared heat penetrates it without drying, locking in natural juices and flavors.

In this video weâ€™re checking out a burnout with a Honda S2000 and a Flir T1K thermal camera. Itâ€™s pretty mesmerizing to watch, as the tread surface of the tire raises from about 19 degrees Celsius to over 160 degrees in less than five seconds.

Shout out to Braden Carlson for the epic burnout while I filmed! His channel here:
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8agwGsx8arC9URdrgCY6cw

You can see the heat the tires lay down onto the ground with perfect lines for the tire grooves. The tires themselves are spitting out bits of melted rubber which coats the ground, rear fender, and inside the wheel wells.

I decided to change the tire pressure left to right to see if there were any differences. The right tire has a pressure of 27 psi, 5 below recommended, while the left tire is at 37 psi, 5 above recommended. Ultimately, it made very little difference as both tires were evenly melted across the tread pattern. Thereâ€™s simply too much friction for too long to notice a significant difference.

If we analyze the burnout at a much lower frame rate from the very beginning, we can see that on the under-inflated tire, the left portion of the tire heats up first. This is actually because the rear tire is out of alignment, and has excessive negative cambers, so the load on the tire rests primarily on the inside. If the tire were to have the correct factory alignment, the heating would occur much more evenly.

The tire surface temperature, in just four frames, less than 1/7th of a second, increases from 19 celsius to 43.5. In less than two seconds, the surface temperature of the inside of the tire reaches 160 degrees, or about 320 degrees Fahrenheit, and by five seconds, the entire tread is roasting above 160.

After the burnout, you can see the garage floor covered in hot rubber, and the rear brakes have heated to over 300 degrees Celsius or about 600 Fahrenheit. The rotors even got a bit of color from getting so hot. The tires themselves have now turned into a pile of debris. Itâ€™s time for newer, nicer, wider rubber.

AHCvd6VsGGU,ASMR Styrofoam models vs thermal knife (oddly satisfying),"Hello everyone,

The idea of making a video in which I would cut through styrofoam models with a thermal knife
has been in my mind since the end of the last year. Considering my tendency to procrastinate, I knew beforehand that it is gonna take me some time
to get it done, so I decided to buy all of the necessary props just after coming up with this idea back in December 2016

I thought I'll be able to make this video in my recording studio, but it turned out that the heat from the blade generates so much smelly fumes while cutting the styrofoam that it made the whole process
unbearable and very unsafe. It was impossible to do it in studio conditions even when I kept the window wide opened.

I was so pissed off that it made me completely unwilling to find a solution to the problem right away. What do I do when there is nothing I can hold on to? Yes you are right. Procrastination takes the helm.

After a few months I realised that the only way to get this video done is to do it outside, late at night. But wait a minute, what my neighbours will think when they spot me with a knife cutting through a fake frog in the middle of the night?
Firstly I thought about that old retired men from across the street who decided to built a house just next to mine probably in order to escape from the hustle and bustle of the big city. He is such a humble person. All he probably needs is just some peace.

OK. I made the video, and it just so happened that he probably spoted me... I didn't see him during the night, but he has started acting so strange and unusual every time when he sees me.
He probably thinks that it was better to live his life in the presence of the traffic noises rther than a weirdo who records himself while doing a vivisection of a styrofoam frog in the middle of the night. Maybe it wouldn'd have looked so scary and strange if I hadn't worn a full breathing mask.

Should I approach him and explain what ASMR is or will it make matters even worse?

In this episode, the Roswell Flight Test Crew sneaks onto the show floor at CES one day early to get a peek at the FLIR Duo: a combined visible light and thermal imaging camera the same size and shape as a GoPro, developed specifically for use on drones. The thermal image is captured by a Lepton sensor with a resolution of 160x120 pixels operating at 9 frames per second, and the visible light sensor captures HD video. The camera is available in two models: the Duo and the Duo R. The Duo provides thermal and visible light imaging, and the Duo R adds radiometric capabilities â€“ the ability to determine the temperature of an object at a distance. Both cameras are available now on the FLIR website. The Duo sells for $999 and the Duo R sells for $1,299.",Roswell Flight Test Crew

syRQL7t6yPA,India develops first indigenous thermal imaging devices,"Made in India


The technology, the scientists say, can be used for a range of applications such as night vision, surveillance and â€” going beyond military and security operations â€” even in the detection of cancers.

â€œThe successful development and demonstration of indigenous infrared sensors to image human objects is a major milestone for the Indian scientific community,â€ says Subhananda Chakrabarti, of IIT-Bâ€™s department of electrical engineering, where the infrastructure for creating the sensor was developed.

In an air conditioned room in the department, Prof. Chakrabarti and his team are able to use the sensor to capture startlingly clear images of human subjects, even when the room is in complete darkness. The sensor captures the thermal signature emanated by a subject and is accurate to the point of picking up minor temperature differences: put your hand on a cold surface for two seconds for instance, and that sport on your palm registers darker on the camera.

â€œThe focal plane arrays, which is at the heart of all thermal imagers, involves a number of complex fabrication steps,â€ Prof. Chakrabarti says.

â€œIIT Bombayâ€™s research group have successfully optimised each of these steps in-house and thereby the flipchip bonded sensor arrays can be entirely fabricated in this country. This will make the indigenous thermal imaging or night-vision technology affordable and cheaper and will serve as a perfect example of Made In India.â€

CLIaCu2opcc,"TSP #70 - FLIR MR160 Thermal Imaging & Moisture Meter Review, Teardown & Experiments","In this episode Shahriar takes a close look at the FLIR MR160 Thermal Imaging and Moisture Meter. Featuring Infrared Guided Measurement (IGM) technology powered by a FLIR LeptonÂ® thermal imaging sensor, MR160 helps you quickly see temperature patterns that point to potential hidden moisture so you know right where to place the meter probe to capture accurate readings.

After an overview of the camera functions a full teardown of the instrument is presented. The FLIR MR160 is based on a single PIC32 processor with built-in capacitance measurement capability. The MR160 is then used to detect a moisture spot on a floor tiling. The presence of moisture is then verified with both the pin-less and pin-based moisture measurement capability of the MR160. Finally, the MR160 is also used to measure temperature variation across a bank of resistors.

Chained to a love, but that donâ€™t mean much
Sensitive tough, you donâ€™t get enough
Iâ€™ve been drowning in you, lost in the rush
Faded, you stuck? Iâ€™ll help you up
I Donâ€™t care to get too loud, sexy I want you now
Bet I can take you there, whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel, lets just enjoy the thrill
Iâ€™ll take over the wheel, Iâ€™ll give you the touch youâ€™re missing
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low

Get low, get low
Girl You got the vibe Iâ€™m up for the climb
I like the way you take me there, I like the way you touch yourself
Donâ€™t hold back, I want that
when the water come down Iâ€™mma get in that
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
Girl You got the vibe Iâ€™m up for the climb
As beautiful as you are, I want to light all your dark
Maybe you donâ€™t believe in me, itâ€™s hard to know what you see in me
Donâ€™t be quick to say no, my chest is your pillow
Come out of the shadows,
I know that youâ€™re fragile
Yea

I Donâ€™t care to get too loud, sexy I want you now
Bet I can take you there, whispering in your ear
What do you wanna feel, lets just enjoy the thrill
Iâ€™ll take over the wheel, Iâ€™ll give you the touch youâ€™re missing
Get low, get low
Hands on your waist, lets go

Hands on your waist, lets go
Get low, get low
Girl You got the vibe Iâ€™m up for the climb

Iâ€™m right here you know
When your waves explode
Escape the undertow
know youâ€™ve been broken
know that  you been hoping
swimming  in your ocean
A new life is floating
The stars were made to shine
Reach up and make a wish
Itâ€™s a beautiful time
I hope you take a glimpse
Weâ€™re the sound of lovers blowing crazy in the wind
You donâ€™t have to pretend
I donâ€™t care where youâ€™ve been
Get low, get low

THERMAL POWER PLANT
Electricity can also be produced at thermo-electric fuel-burning generating stations that burn fossil fuels.Large amount of fossil fuels are burnt every day in power stations to heat up water to produce steam which further runs the turbine to generate electricity. The transmission of electricity is more efficient than transporting coal or petroleum over the same distance. Therefore, many thermal power plants are set up near coal or oil fields. The term thermal power plant is used since fuel is burnt to produce heat energy which is converted into electrical energy.",7activestudio

lVWGwPkhUA0,Hunting with Night Vision and Thermal Imaging | 42 Hogs Down and 9 Coyotes,"42 Hogs down and 9 coyotes down with the help of night vision and thermal imaging for hunting at night. Through the use of simultaneous side-by-side footage comparing various NV and thermal scopes, this video illustrates the advantages and disadvantages of 3rd Gen night vision vs thermal imaging for hog hunting and coyote hunting at night.

The use of night vision and thermal imaging technology for predator management and hog eradication is becoming more and more common in places like Texas. Each year feral hogs cause millions of dollars in damage in the form of damaged crops, contaminated water supplies, broken equipment, transmission of disease and injury to livestock.

Due to their intelligence, adaptability, and prolific breeding habits, traditional methods of hunting and trapping have been largely ineffective in reducing the feral hog population. Since feral hogs are not considered game animals in Texas they may be hunted by any means or methods at any time of year. Recently, with the increased availability and affordability of night vision and thermal optics, farmers, hunters and citizens alike have access to new weapons/tools to aid in the fight against feral hogs.

VnptcYpuHXs,Defeating Drones: How To Build A Thermal Evasion Suit,"Why has it taken so long for practical thermal evasion methods to be introduced to the civilian market?  There are multiple reasons.  But the first would be that many average people unfortunately have little to no concern over thermal vision based weapons systems.  They believe that all of these weapons reside in the hands of governments, governments which supposedly have the best interests of the citizenry at heart.  Why should they develop or purchase a thermal evasion system when the â€œgood guysâ€ have all the thermal toys?  This is blind faith in an establishment which has not earned our trust...

Sadly, with the advent of numerous privacy and liberty crushing programs, it is safe to say that not all governments if any governments have the best interests of the public at heart.  In fact, many governments today are training to subdue and control their respective populations rather than protect them.

A thermal evasion suit is a tool, like any other tool.  We at Snakebite Tactical intend it to be a tool for defense.  We believe fully in the cause of liberty for all peoples, and we believe that thermal evasion is just as essential in maintaining that liberty as the right to bear arms is.  We hope that this contribution to the liberty movement as a whole will help turn the tide of tyranny back, and give Americans a chance to rejuvenate the constitutional principles that once made our society honorably unique in the pages of history.

SDz3kXAcHxA,Testo 870 Thermal Imager - Thermography in Industrial Maintenance,"This video walks you through a routine inspection at the Rothaus Brewery in Germany using the Testo 870 Thermal Imaging Camera. First stop is to a steam trap which is working as intended as the heat does not continue to the right, indicating no loss of steam. A quick glance at a switching cabinet shows if any components are faulty. A stop at a pump inside the brew house shows a bearing starting to overheat, needing replacement.

In this video weâ€™re going to be cold starting the engine of my 2016 Subaru Crosstrek, and using a thermal camera weâ€™re going to watch the engine heat up. The ambient temperature is about negative 6 degrees Celsius or about 22 degrees Fahrenheit. As far as metrics weâ€™ll be monitoring, weâ€™ve got overlays of the engine RPM, which will run higher when the engine first starts to help warm things up. We also have throttle position, the coolant and intake air temperatures, the temperature of where the thermal camera is centered, and a timestamp so we know how long the engine has been running.

If itâ€™s freezing outside and you donâ€™t want to get in a frozen car, no oneâ€™s going to fault you for warming up the engine and making sure itâ€™s comfortable inside, as well as making sure the windows are defrosted so youâ€™re ready to roll. In my video I was purely discussing whatâ€™s happening from a mechanical standpoint when you let your engine sit and idle.

Oil can actually flow at very low temperatures. You may be freezing, but for certain viscosity grades cold temperatures arenâ€™t a huge deal. For example, my Honda S2000 recommends a 10W-30 oil, and it only recommends going down to a thinner 5W grade oil if ambient temperatures drop below minus 20 degrees C. Minus 20 degrees C! And this is logical based on SAE cold temperature viscosity ratings.

For example, a 0W oil needs to be able to pump at -40 degrees C. A 5W oil needs to be able to pump at -35 degrees C. A 10W oil needs to be able to flow at -30 degrees C, and so on. Oil can do a decent job of protecting your engine even at low temperatures, as long as youâ€™re not asking the engine for too much power. Try to keep the revs low, and be light on the throttle until the engine is warmed up. Getting up to higher vehicle speeds is fine, as long as your acceleration is gentle and steady, and youâ€™re mindful of your engine RPM. Source: http://www.viscopedia.com/viscosity-tables/substances/sae-viscosity-grades/

Now inevitably someone in the comments is going to say they live in an area with negative 40 degrees C temps and they always warm there car up for several minutes before taking off. A couple of things to note here: first, thatâ€™s obviously super cold, and I canâ€™t blame you for wanting the interior to be warm. Second, make sure youâ€™re using a viscosity grade that can flow in these conditions. 0W is designed for this. Third, with temperatures this low, itâ€™s a good idea to get an electric engine block heater so your engine wonâ€™t have to strain so hard to get oil flowing throughout.

At about 5 minutes and 20 seconds, when the coolant temperature reaches 50 degrees C, youâ€™ll notice the engine RPM starts to significantly drop, eventually getting down to 800 RPM when the coolant reaches 60 degrees C.

l5W8tHkJZ6k,MicroCAM 1024HD High Definition Thermal Imaging - Badgers and Foxes,"This movie made by Martin Dohrn of Ammonite Films was shot using a Thermoteknix MicroCAM 1024HD High Definition Thermal Imager.  Ammonite is an independent film production company making high definition films about science and natural history.

Ammonite previously used Thermoteknix MIRICLE Thermal Imaging Cameras to make Night of the Lion and the subsequent series of Nightstalkers which aired on Nat Geo TV.

MicroCAM 1024HD uses the very latest 1024Ã—768 17um uncooled LWIR sensor technology for stunning high definition images. Conventional TV resolution 640Ã—480 devices traditionally used analogue video standards such as NTSC or PAL to transfer images to the display device. With the advent of high definition sensors, digital interfaces are now expected to provide substantially higher quality display capabilities. MicroCAM 1024HD uses GigE Vision to transfer raw sensor data to the host computer where image and graphic processing takes place.",Thermoteknix Systems Ltd
