UQpas5XN0OQ,Mod Spotlight - Thermal Dynamics,"Thermal Expansion pipes are back and more awesome than ever! Itemduct, fluiduct, and the re-named power transporting Fluxducts provide item, fluid and power mobility that's simple, and practical.
We'll also be covering the new servos, retrievers and filters that are used to enhance the performance of the duct's, and discuss some practical situations in which you could use them.

There's been a lot of changes that you'll need to know about, and we'll discuss in detail in this Thermal Dynamics tutorial / mod spotlight!

vZc2nyfVhhM,Infrared Heat Lamps,"Originally recorded November 16, 2015.

Found these honkin' 250 watt infrared heat lamps at Lowes on clearance for $1.37!  Ended up with a bunch of them.

These used to be used a lot more often in the late 70s and early 80s, and it's a shame they went out in favor of other technologies.  The bulb is 100% efficient:  every watt of power going in comes out as light and heat.  Plus, the bulb only heats the person under it, instead of the entire room, which saves on energy.

If these lights are coupled with an in-wall wind-up timer, they cannot be accidentally left on, preventing the waste of energy.  I look forward to installing these in the bathrooms in the future.

Afterwards I show another one of my fantastic ideas, which hasn't been fully thought out yet.  Next step is to build the prototype and test it, which will be coming up shortly.",jaykay18,12/15/2015 11:56,14772,0:04:51,23,14,3.486486435,Howto & Style,7,"[[u'65bug519', u'looks like the eye from the HAL computer in space odyssey 2001'], [u'wtam69', u""Ouch!

9HfJNnoRMPA,A Simple explanation of Infrared Spectroscopy.,"This video provides a simple explanation of IR spectroscopy. It looks at 4 main areas and these are as follows: -
1. IR radiation and converting wavelength to wavenumbers.
2. Types of bond vibrations (stretching, bending, rocking, twisting and wagging).
3. An outline of the inner working of an IR spectometer.
4. Analyzing IR spectra - Regions and Zones.

VBi28RnDFrc,The Char-Broil TRU-Infrared Electric Patio Bistro,"Four out of five people agree, Char-Broil® TRU-Infrared™ is better than any other grill they've ever used.  Let's see why.

Char-Broil TRU-Infrared prevents flare-ups and promises much juicier food. There are no ""hot spots"" or ""cold spots"" to avoid, just pure even heat.  The Patio Bistro has a precision temperature dial to control TRU-Infrared's wide range from low and slow roasting to extremely hot searing heat.

If you live in a place where gas grills are restricted or you just don't like dealing with the gas tank, the electric Patio Bistro is a perfect fit.  With its small footprint and standard 120V plug on a 6 foot cord, it meets requirements for many high-rise balconies or small condo patios, yet it cooks big in every way.  It has 1750 watts of grilling power and with 320 square inches of cooking area, can handle up to 20 burgers at once. And with Char-Broil TRU-Infrared, they'll be some of the juiciest burgers you've ever grilled.

The Patio Bistro has porcelain-coated premium grates that hold the heat and are easy to clean. Drop wood chips directly on the grates for delicious smoky wood flavors like Apple and Hickory. You can roll it into a corner for neat storage or leave it out as a handsome feature for neighbors to admire.

Features:
-Infrared grills with the convenience of full-sized grilling in a compact design.
-Plugs into any 120V outlet
-240 sq. in. porcelain-coated primary cooking surface
-80 sq. in. secondary cooking surface
-Red porcelain-coated grill body
-Temperature gauge on top of hood allows for monitoring grill temperature at a glance.
-Cool touch handle and hinged lid for no-hassle access to your foods
-Storage grate to keep your tools close at hand
-Strong, durable wheels for quick and easy storage and maneuverability

c0qwlokpnk0,Coyote Hunting with Thermal - 13 Coyotes Down with the ATN ThOR Thermal Scope,"Coyote hunting in South Dakota with O'Neill Ops. Not only are the guys from O'Neil Ops expert predator hunters who have pioneered and mastered the art of coyote hunting suppressed, but they are also 4th-generation farmers and ranchers who have a duty to protect the cattle that they raise for our food. For them, predator hunting is not merely a sport, but a way of life.

James O'Neil has been hunting and shooting since he was 4 years-old. He started out helping skin coyotes with his father when pelts brought a 100 dollars a piece, and eventually learned how to call coyotes with his father and grandfather during coyote calling competitions.

After years of honing his skills at predator calling and hunting during the day, O'Neil helped pave the way for hunters in South Dakota to be able to use thermal and night vision optics to effectively hunt predators at night.

O'Neil played an important role in helping to convince the  South Dakota legislature to allow private land owners to use of night vision and thermal scopes in conjunction with calibers under .225 inches in diameter.

The change in the size of rifle rounds allowed for use with NV and thermal imaging is significant because one of the most popular varmint hunting rifle rounds uses a .223 caliber bullet. The .223 caliber bullet is also the most widely used caliber in AR-15 style modern sporting rifles.

frtQxryDTo8,Converting a Compact Digital Camera to Shoot Infrared Only - 1. removing the infrared filter,"In this video I show you how to convert Panasonic Lumix travel zoom camera ( the TZ6 - TZ10 or ZS3 - ZS7 or any camera with at least a 35mm lens flange diameter)  to shoot infrared only. By removing the infrared blocking filter from the camera we increase the overall sensitivity of the camera to infrared and then to prevent visible light from affecting the display we install a infrared pass filter which blocks all wavelengths of light below 720nm (all visible light). I show the step by step procedures to do this and show the type of results to be expected after the conversion.

I recently tried my first IR conversion, on an Olympus C5050Z. The work re. the IR blocking filter went well, but I ruined a ribbon cable (there were 8 of them on the way to the sensor!) and that was the end of it. The Lumix model you converted seems to have a shorter, easier path. My question concerns removing the IR blocker but not replacing it with another piece of glass (same dimensions). I\'ve seen comments in other articles that the auto focus does not work without a replacement (clear glass e.g. cut from a microscope slide). Other comments are that it is tricky to find the exact thickness (the Olympus had a 3mm thick IR blocker), and cutting the glass to the proper dimensions. Any thoughts? BTW, in my ill-fated attempt, I followed an alternative procedure I\'d seen, which was to ""sand"" off the IR blocking filter from the surface of the glass substrate, rubbing the face on a flat sheet of acrylic, using a lightly abrasive cream (auto paint refinisher).

Bio does not exist as it gets tilled into the ground to make soil in place.  If this was not done, erosion of soil would happen even faster than it is now.  An already MASSIVE problem that few talk about.  The State of Iowa for instance used to have over 12 inches of top soil (30cm) on average.  In many places it is down to around 4 inches(10cm) now in a 120 years of tilling.  This is not sustainable.  Greenhouses and aquapoinics will solve this but this takes HUGE investment in infrastructure and horrendous amounts of energy and WATER.  For instance, China has roughly 1million acres of greenhouses already and is building them as fast as possible as they are running out of food and their arable land is degrading swiftly in soil quality.

Individual homes do buy that solution for sure. The result ? No more grid. No more bills.

Term salt is not referring to sodium chloride as many people think, but rather to many compounds containing chlorides, fluorides, nitrates, etc.\n\nIn the case of thermal storage, here are some information on the wikipedia:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_storage\n\n""Molten salt can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough so that it can be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995-1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity.[7][8][9] The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate. It is non-flammable and nontoxic, and has already been used in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid, so experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications.\nThe salt melts at 131 \xb0C (268 \xb0F). It is kept liquid at 288 \xb0C (550 \xb0F) in an insulated ""cold"" storage tank. The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it to 566 \xb0C (1,051 \xb0F). It is then sent to a hot storage tank. This is so well insulated that the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week.""\n\nSo, yes - it \'consumes\' a lot of free solar energy, but the goal is not bring molten salt (mixture) into boil, but rather into thermal transport and storage.\n\nAnd, then:\n\n""When electricity is needed, the hot salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce superheated steam for a turbine/generator as used in any conventional coal, oil or nuclear power plant. A 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank of about 9.1 metres (30 ft) tall and 24 metres (79 ft) in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design.""\n\nIf you try to do the same job of thermal storage with water (which has pretty good thermal capacity), it has some problems with self cooling by evaporation, and for better efficiency require pressurized tanks (similar to pressure cooker).\xa0\n\nCheers!']]",thermal

When doing house chores, you are constantly sweating. I just wrap my hair up and get busy with the heavy cleaning twice a week. On those days, I drink a lot of water and found putting Himalayan salt rock under my tongue when feeling a bit tired gives me renewed energy coupled with a bottle of water. I reflected back on those days and those have been the days my skin has felt the softest and most glowing. An unexpected detox blessing that I am now thanking the Lord for.

mnBxZONfxBA,Budget Thermal Imaging with the Raspberry Pi 2,"Short video demo of Thermography using the Raspberry Pi 2 and the Melexis MLX90620 16x4 thermopile array.

Parts Used:
 - Raspberry Pi 2
 - small HDMI monitor  or PiTFT
 - Raspberry Pi Camera
 - MLX90620 16x4 thermopile array
 - 1N4001 diode

The MLX sensor is bolted to the raspberry pi camera and they are pointed in the same direction. The sensor is I2C and will work on 3.3V, but runs best on ~2.6V. So the 1N4001 diode is used to lower the voltage to the positive pin of the MLX90620. This sensor also requires 'repeat starts'. So the BCM2835 library is used instead of the kernel I2c device driver.

Software consists of two programs-
 mlxd - a simple user space device driver/daemon written in C that reads the sensor and writes the temperature array to a FIFO
 mlxview.py - a demo script that access the fifo and the pi camera, generates a color heat map from the array and overlays it on the camera preview.

9ENklTz-E-k,Halogen Infrared Illuminator DIY,"In this video, I'm testing 12 volt, 50 watt halogen spotlights as infrared illuminators.

I place an IR Pass Filter in front of the bulb meaning only infrared light is allowed to pass through. When looking at the light with the human eye, you see a very dim red glow, but when looking through an IR capable camera, you see a huge flood of infrared light being emitted.

Since the camera is low lux and I'm living in a highly light polluted city, I'm placing an IR Pass Filter in front of the camera too, to ensure it's primarily picking up only the IR light being emitted by our test bulbs and not all the wonderful light pollution.

In a real-world situation, I'd probably let the camera use visible light and IR, to get the best quality picture. But for testing how strong the IR is, we don't want to allow the camera to use visible light to boost the image.

I had to change location because the number of cars driving by with halogen headlights and halogen fog lights was making it extremely difficult to perform accurate tests.

The military used to do something similar to this. They had glass IR Pass Filters that bolted over their regular vehicle headlights (halogen bulbs). This allowed them to drive around in stealth while greatly improving the performance of their night vision goggles. They also had IR pass filters to cover a rear brake which held an incandescent bulb. This was useful for convoys where the driver behind was wearing night vision goggles, being able to easily determine when the vehicle in front is slowing down.

I also showed 8 Watt IR LED as a comparison against the Halogen bulbs.",Gadget Addict,1/20/2014 2:41,30834,0:05:41,60,6,4.636363506,Science & Technology,9,"[[u'david pe\xf1a paredes', u'hola amigo de que material es el vidrio negro que usas en este video'], [u'\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bbf\u0bb4\u0bbf\u0bb2\u0bcd \u0ba4\u0bc6\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bcb', u'where can i buy this ir pass filtet'], [u'Sam Sen', u'Where do I fine a good and cheap IR filter?'], [u'Luigi Tesla Parisi', u'Hi, can i ask you the spec s of the IR LED illuminators?

wyno4f3DC70,LIVE Archive: Hands on with the FLIR Q14 Thermal Imaging Monocular,"The Q14 Thermal Imaging Monocular represents the latest evolution in our quest to reduce size, weight, and power while maximizing the number of available features and functions. The Q14's compact size ensures that it can be concealed in a shirt pocket and its featherweight mass at 240g makes it the lightest muli-function thermal currently on the market. Helmet or weapon mountable, it is equipped with digital compass and inclinometer and can come with either a visible or IR laser pointer. It has wireless and bluetooth features and can be matched up with FLIRs thermal accessories including the HD DVR and Extended Battery Pack.

gKQ9yTef2pw,How TRU-Infrared Grilling Works,"How Char-Broil® TRU-Infrared™ Works

The science behind TRU-Infrared tells a juicy story. Unlike traditional gas grills that use convective heat (hot air) to cook food, Char-Broil's TRU-Infrared grills limit the hot air flow and use natural, radiant heat to cook food directly without drying. While convective heat destroys food's moisture barrier, infrared heat penetrates it without drying, locking in natural juices and flavors.

WdQgmb0x-_Y,Thermal Imaging for Benchtop Electronics Design - Meet the FLIR ETS320,"John Larkin talks about the challenges Highland Technology faces when testing electronics, and how using benchtop thermal imaging like the new FLIR ETS320 make that even easier and more efficient!

The FLIR ETS320 thermal imaging solution is our first camera designed for quick temperature checks on PCB boards and electronic devices in the lab. Save time and eliminate guesswork by measuring temperatures across more than 76,000 points at once with the sensitive, accurate 320 x 240 detector. Engineered specifically for lab electronics testing, the ETS 320 is battery powered and hands free, and connects via USB to your PC for immediate analysis and sharing of thermal data.

FLIR ONE iPhone Infrared Camera Accessory Case

The FLIR ONE attaches to any iPhone 5 or 5S, turning it into a pocket sized thermal camera. The case roughly doubles the thickness of the iPhone and includes both a thermal and visible light camera. The FLIR ONE will capture and store both still thermal images and thermal video. The resulting stored data can be shared seamlessly through Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram, or even saved to the iPhone camera roll.

Every object gives off heat, even if very cold. The FLIR ONE thermal camera takes thousands of measurements of this heat to create a meaningful thermal image of the world around you. Applications are almost endless: use it as a night vision camera, a security camera, or locate wildlife or a missing pet. Easily use the FLIR ONE to find energy leaks in a building such as missing insulation, or air leakage around doors and windows. Because it changes temperature at a different rate, water leaks or possible mold conditions are possible to detect with a thermal imager. Even use the FLIR ONE to identify dangerous electrical circuits or overheating motors and bearings.

The FLIR ONE MX app is available for free and offers a host of features. It includes FLIR's excellent MSX technology which combines the digital and infrared pictures to give the clearest image. You can also change the color palette of the thermal image for better clarity or user preference. Even turn the spot temperature measurement function on and off as needed.

The FLIR ONE Infrared Camera includes its own internal battery which will power the unit for up to two hours. If needed, the software app includes an option to use the FLIR ONE battery as a backup battery for the iPhone itself, similar to other available battery boost packs. The camera case charges through a standard micro USB.",Ivy Tools,1/8/2014 4:27,51667,0:01:38,117,10,4.68503952,Science & Technology,9,"[[u'TERRAMOUNT', u'pretty sweet!'], [u'haze4476', u'Check out the HemaImager - much cheaper and works on other devices including iPhones.\xa0 Looks to have a better range and graphics too.\n\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ebeall/hemaimager-accessible-thermal-imaging-for-smart-de'], [u'Aclept', u'When a someone is done putting their pin code done and you are next, you sneaky take a picture of the pin thing, then seak the heat on the buttons = profit'], [u'Bryan Moross', u'Night Ops!\n\u591c\u306e\u30b5\u30d0\u30b2\u30fc\u306b\u4f7f\u3048\u305d\u3046\uff01'], [u'Frankie Haze', u'man comin for ya crop'], [u'Alexander Gentile', u'Take my money'], [u'\u6c88\u79c9\u878d', u'\u9810\u77e5\u65b0\u914d\u5099!!'], [u'Kim Krumpf', u'nice one, too expensive for who just wonna play with...'], [u'Joey Isabelle', u'Want!\n']]",infrared

SkktSQNP5-g,Thermal Imaging threat and intimidation by Fresno Law Enforcement.,"This is the same Fresno California Sheriff crew that has been illegally entering my property and home when I leave my house. Here they are using an Infra-Red Thermal Imager to see if I am home. They then phone a waiting second party with information as to weather or not I am home.  Fresno PD fails to fully investigate my complaint on this incident which I fully detailed in my Fresno PD Internal Affairs complaint.  If anyone can identify any of the Fresno Sheriff personnel in this video please forward their names.

I am being targeted by multiple City of Fresno departments and the Fresno Sheriff's Office for comments I made on the Fresno Bee from 2009 to 2013. Comments that were critical of the way Fresno PD and Fresno Fire utilized their budgets. My Disqus handle during that time was ""John21"". Posters on the Fresno Bee, using the then Disqus comment system were suppose to be anonymous. However, Fresno Bee employee Jody Murray shared Fresno Bee log data and ip address information with Jared L McCormick, a Fresno Sheriff Sergeant, who then used the Fresno Bee provided information to retrieve name and address information in order to maliciously track-down, stalk, and harass Fresno Bee comment posters, including myself.  McCormick's Disqus handle on the Bee was ""Hikerdude1967"". I notified Jim Boren, the then Fresno Bee Editor via email on two occasions in 2013 regarding an employee at the Bee who was sharing website ip and log data of Fresno Bee commenters with Fresno PD and Fresno Sheriff personnel. I explained in these emails that as a result of Jody Murray's nefarious efforts Fresno Bee commenters were subsequently stalked and harassed by Fresno Law Enforcement. I never received a reply from from Mr. Boren on either occasion. However, consequently, I have been made a constant target of harassment, intimidation, and worse by multiple City of Fresno Departments and the Fresno Sheriff's office.

LTpHNyQ_oW4,UFO Sightings: INFRARED UFOS (!!) INVISIBLE ORBS Hidden World 18+ UFO Captures! Newport Beach 2015,"The video covers 18+ UFO  captures filmed in infrared during the day and night from my balcony in Newport Beach CA.

Many ufos are invisible to our eyes and reside outside of the visible spectrum in the infrared and ultra violet ranges of light. Utilizing full spectrum cameras and night vision monoculars were able to get a glimpse into this hidden world that's all around us.

Part 1 covers my transition from Generation 3 Night Vision into Full Spectrum daylight recording. Working with Spencer's Camera  we converted my Canon 70D into a Full Spectrum camera and fitted my Canon Telephoto lens with various filters to record in infrared.

Part 2 of the video highlights the best ufo captures recorded in infrared over the past year in Newport Beach. Each recording was highly scrutinized and analyzed in the editing room and produced for maximum viewer satisfaction and ease of studying the objects.

UPTAsUkqIlg,Benefits of Infrared Grills & Burners | What is an Infrared Grill? | BBQGuys.com,"I am often asked what exactly is an infrared burner, what are the advantages of infrared grilling?  In this video, we take a look at what makes infrared a great addition to your outdoor kitchen!
Check out our selection of Infrared Grills: http://www.bbqguys.com/category_path_10503.html?sstring=infrared

Some information about Infrared:
QUICK PREHEAT, EASY GRILLING: Preheat your infrared grill on high in as little as 3-5 minutes! Infrared heat cooks food faster as well. We all lead busy lives and sometimes don't have time to grill after work during the week. This quick pre-heat and faster cook time allows you to grill more during the week and not just on the weekends anymore!

JUICIER FOOD: Infrared grilling means your food will retain up to 35% more of its own natural juices, which produces incredibly tender and juicy results.

EVEN HEAT: Infrared grills can provide very even heat distribution across the grill, reducing the hot and cold spots often found on non-infrared grills. TEC and Solaire are two brands that score very high marks for even heat distribution.

STEAKHOUSE QUALITY SEARING: The majority of infrared grills reach incredibly high searing temperatures to produce mouthwatering, restaurant quality steaks. That said, infrared grills are not just high heat grills anymore. Technology has improved over the years and several infrared grills allow you to cook with precise control on low heat as well, such as TEC and Lynx.

MINIMAL FLARE-UPS: One of the most inconvenient hassles of traditional gas grills are the unpredictable flare-ups. Infrared grilling drastically reduces the chance of flare ups. TEC's radiant glass panel system virtually eliminates flare ups while ceramic infrared brands like Solaire and Lynx will produce some flame kiss.

ENERGY EFFICIENT: Compared to traditional gas grills, infrared grills burn less gas to reach the same temperature, saving you money on fuel.

EASY CLEAN-UP: Most infrared grills are super easy to clean, by simply turning the temperature to high when finished cooking. This will turn any food particles and residue into ash for a quick and easy clean-up! The grill that scores the highest marks for easy clean ups is TEC's Patio FR.

RhIDO_1vQOo,Lepton number,"Lepton number

 In particle physics, the lepton number is a conserved quantum number representing the number of leptons minus the number of antileptons in an elementary particle reaction.In equation form, so all leptons have assigned a value of +1, antileptons −1, and non-leptonic particles 0.

Special thanks for Flir for sending me this tool for review.

This is quickly becoming one of my favorite diagnostic tools. I've used an inferred thermometer for years with pretty good results, but this tool is above and beyond that. Not only can it accurately tell me the temperature of an object, it can also give me a full color thermal image of it in real time. I call it, 'Predator vision'. I feel like I've only just scratched the surface of what this tool is capable of. Rest assured, you'll be seeing this in many upcoming ETCG repair videos.

After all, technology today has the capability of designing a safer car in case of crash, all based on science / methodology however they still crash the car to check the results.  Could one not take the massive spreadsheet data with ""everything"" turned on, and then sort it (data) to come up with data of matching variables?  Example:  If voltage varies, say during a turbo-boost, then find the data where this occurs in comparisons and align it accordingly to read that thermal data comparison only.

the seriously committed hunter to the military designated marksman. While primarily designed as a weapon scope, the Zeus functions equally well in its collateral assignments as a magnified spotting scope or handheld thermal imager.
The Zeus is a solid state, uncooled, long-wave infrared, magnified dedicated weapon scope intended for day and night engagements without the need to remove the sight from the rifle. The 24/7 mission capability is only one of the strengths of Zeus. The thermal imaging technology also allows you to detect targets by cutting through snow, dust, smoke, fog, haze, and other atmospheric obscurants. Unlike the use of laser targeting or near-infrared illumination to augment night vision equipment, the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight is extremely difficult to detect with other devices as it emits no visible light or RF energy.
In addition to being the smallest and lightest in their class, Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sights are characterized by their simple and intuitive controls, functions and features that are layered among direct button adjustments, direct combination button functions, and electronic menu selections. This ""layering"" of easy-to-understand control functions provides the operator with a framework for customizing his preferences
and exploiting the robust variety of setting options available in the Zeus. The Zeus has a unique series of menu selectable temperature sensitive ""scenarios"" for rapid target detection in addition to a variety of color display presentations based on a rich, upgradeable software package. A wireless remote switch is included to activate the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight when positioned in the ""standby"" mode. The Zeus has the ability to record imagery and is equipped with a video-out capability in operator selectable NTSC or PAL formats. The Zeus uses the same multi-pin connector to provide both video-in imagery, where there is a need for map or rangefinder display overlays, and external power access.
Zeus weapon installation is easy, repeatable, and reliable based on a unique and highly user-friendly MIL-STD-1913/WEAVER/PICATINNY rail compatible quick-release locking mechanism. The solid state technology and software algorithms combined with a complimentary color reticle platform used in the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight ensure maximum reticle contrast, high level target accuracy, and boresight retention that
cannot be achieved with mechanical boresight adjusters and traditional ballistic drums. This level of accuracy is translated into the electronic zoom (e-zoom) function of the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sights which can be progressively increased from 1x to 2x to 4x and 8x without changing the point-of-aim to point-of-impact relationship of the targeting reticle.
Armasight is convinced that the Zeus Thermal Imaging Weapon Sight represents one of the most sophisticated sighting devices available to hunters, SWAT Teams, and the Military on the market today based on superior price-to-performance value.

SozPP2NXDE8,Let's make an InfraRed Headset,"I had an idea about using InfraRed LEDs harvested from old TV remote controls. The simplest project I could come up with was to convert an ordinary cheap LED headlamp to InfraRed.

Summary: I did this because I wanted to see if it was feasible.
The end result proves it can be done, but the truth is the illumination achieved by just 9 LEDs is poor.

A quick search on eBay shows I could have bought a 36 LED array board for £2.15 with free postage or a ""48 LED Illuminator Light CCTV IR Infrared Night Vision Security Camera Leds Lamp"" for £5.63 with free postage. They would both require a 12v supply so obviously it depends what you need to achieve.

So this was a successful project but not really worth the effort unless you don't need much illumination, perhaps for watching a nestbox or similar.

I have a scrap mobile phone that I have rigged up to use as a wireless webcam and might try combining this infrared light with it for that purpose.

One other point to remember is you have no way of knowing if the headlamp is switched on unless you check with something that can see infrared, so it would be easy to leave it switched on and run down the battery. I may modify it to put a small red LED on the back as an indicator.

I have thousands of videos on YouTube covering a wide range of subjects. To find them follow my search guides https://youtu.be/ceBSOoOHcgw or https://youtu.be/Zj4UgwkwYRk or see my playlists page https://www.youtube.com/user/GrandadIsAnOldMan/playlists?flow=grid&view=1
Generally my projects are for my grandchildren to enjoy. OK, I enjoy them too. If anybody else likes them, that is a bonus. I like to keep my work as simple and basic as possible so that it can be copied easily and improved by anybody who wants to try themselves. I recycle or repurpose items rather than buy new and when I do buy I like to keep it cheap.

BZPZfrgbkUQ,High Resolution Thermal Camera 'unboxed',"FYI polyethylene is just a simple thermal window for the camera, that also keeps the camera dry and out of the way of humidity.

The camera (optris pi640) is actually (on the grand scale of things) a midrange camera. Indeed when FLIR came and showed me their cameras, their top camera cost over $100 000!

The FLIR cameras were about twice the price of the Optris cameras (spec for spec).  They are clearly nice, better produced cameras.  However the software to drive them was extortionate. It was almost half the cost of the cameras for the range I was looking at!
The Optris cameras have comparable specs, but the focus is strictly manual (IIRC, the FLIR cameras had autofocus and quick change lenses... you dont get any of that with Optris).

However the bottom line was.
Optris 640*480.... comparable price flir 320*240
frame rates comparable for both
temperature sensitivity comparable for both ~0.05 K
temperature range, both ~-20 to ~1000C
In reality you could get an extra filter for the FLIR, which took it up to ~2000C which would have been useful.  Sadly you have to make your compromises :-(",Thunderf00t,8/6/2016 16:42,64692,0:02:41,3305,54,4.935695171,Entertainment,96,"[[u'Peter Pawlicki', u""i've got a thermal telescope but no sensor. i wish these things weren't so expensive!""], [u'Pyroslav x', u'Would you, i mean anyone REALLY buy software for a camera, for...HOW MUCH?!? ever heard of piracy?

NKi3jEPdzpM,Review of FLIR E6 Thermal Camera Features,"http://www.ivytools.com/FLIR-E6-Infrared-Thermal-Imaging-Camera-63902-0202-p/flir-e6.htm

The FLIR E6 thermal camera offers an excellent combination of performance and price in a camera that is versatile enough to perform many common infrared applications. For building inspection purposes, the E6 meets all standards including RESNET. It has enough resolution (19,200 pixels) and sensitivity (0.06 C) to diagnose air leakage, missing insulation, moisture intrusion and more. For mechanical applications, the FLIR E6 easily images overheating bearings, motors, and electrical circuits, and is great for locating ductwork and plumbing hidden in walls and slabs.

With both thermal and visible light cameras, the E6 is ready to document all problem areas for your report. The E6 can also overlay the images in a picture-in-picture format. The best use of the digital camera, however, is found in FLIR's MSX thermal image enhancement. This real-time process overlays the data from the digital image onto the thermal image, with the effect that you can understand the visible world easily, yet without any loss of thermal data.

Like the other Ex-Series infrared cameras, the FLIR E6 is fitted with a 45 degree wide angle lens, perfect for getting a great view while in tight quarters. Now you can image more of a target with less backing away to get the perfect shot. The E6 will store up to 500 sets of images for convenient playback on the camera or download to a computer. FLIR Tools reporting software is included with the camera for both PC and Mac platforms. FLIR Tools allows for organization and annotation of images, and creates great reports for presenting your findings.",Ivy Tools,5/6/2014 1:56,8036,0:02:31,7,0,5,Science & Technology,0,[],thermal camera

My Channel
I have been haunted since late 2010. My channel is a dedicated paranormal video diary dedicated to the unusual supernatural events that have occurred to me since that time. Paranormal Activity has become almost an everyday occurrence for me since this began and with it my interest in ghosts, demons and poltergeist activity had grown.

It seemed to stop in front of the TV or maybe that\'s just my perception. Great catch !!!  I could see a form passing in front of the tv and what looked like a head ABOVE the screen.  I didn\'t catch the exit if there was one. It just seemed to disappear. I had something like this happen to me many years ago. I was reading in my bedroom on a rainy, gloomy afternoon. By late afternoon I was ready to switch on the bedroom lamp when I saw a gray transparent mass come from the hallway through the bedroom doorway, it turned left floated along side hubby\'s side of the bed, then turned right to enter the bedroom closet. The door to this closet was fully opened. It went inside the closet and disappeared. I don\'t  know if this was my eyes adjusting to the fading light conditions but I could easily see the whole room without a light on, even the print of my book was visible and I could easily see the clothes hanging in the closet through this mass. I wasn\'t scared I was just fascinated. From what I\'ve read on the subject it has something to do with weather conditions, rain and electrical storms making paranormal experiences easier to manifest. Another gray and rainy early afternoon my then 8 yr old niece ( she\'s 26 now) was playing with her younger cousin, my nephew, while he was at his grandmother\'s house. They were playing hide and seek and my niece decided to hide upstairs. Half way up the steps she looked up and saw a black silhouette of a tall woman with a bun in her hair but no legs below her hem line float across the foyer, making a right down the hallway and a left into the second bedroom doorway where she entered and was lost to view. My niece said nothing but asked that her mother be called bc she wanted to go home.  My nephew\'s Gram called my sister and said she thought Briana was maybe getting sick because she was as white as a ghost. On the way home my sister is grilling her about what aches, hurts, are you sick to your stomach etc when the kid says, I\'m not sick, I saw a ghost. So she tells my sister what she saw and my sister says, call your Aunt Toni she knows about these kind of things lol  When she told me the story I knew exactly who she saw. It was the apparition of the grandmother\'s, mother.  I remember her but she died when my niece was 4 and was bedridden for a few years before she passed. She never met her. If there were pictures of her they weren\'t in the downstairs or I would have seen them, I\'d been in her house many times. Yet the kid described her to a T. Tall, thin with a bun in her hair. Also the room where she was bedridden? You guessed it, the room my niece saw her enter was her bedroom. If there\'s one thing my niece isn\'t and never was is a liar. In 26 yrs I never caught her in a lie. She\'s brutally honest and always has been. Even as a teenager when most of us were perfecting lying, she didn\'t. When she screwed up she admitted it. I believe she saw what she saw. I told her it was just great grandma checking up on things and nothing to be scared about. She\'s still ""sensitive"" to this day.  Maybe its the honesty thing. :o)'], [u'Jay Jones', u'So do the ghosts follow you or just your house?'], [u'Sherri Williams', u'I have a name for the cold spot.

The FLIR thermal camera measures the temperature of objects, making it perfect for people working in trades measuring this kind of stuff. It's also waterproof down to 16 feet.

The die-cast frame helps it survive falls onto concrete from 6 feet high, earning it a military-spec durability rating.

zqM-Hsj5NqM,High voltage inspection | Workswell WIRIS - Aerial thermography,"Nowadays, we cannot imagine life without electricity. Although we take it for granted as a part of our lives we do not always realize how demanding it is to be produced and supplied by power plants directly to our homes. The transmission and distribution network is a highly complex system of lines of interconnecting electric energy sources, transformer stations and consumers. Unfortunately, failures can occur within electricity networks that can lead to electricity breakdowns as well as destructive fires. A UAV (drone) with a thermal imaging system installed can be a very useful tool to prevent such problems.

j7uazDKunW4,Flat Roof Infrared Thermal Imaging--Why Most Thermographers Don't Survey Flat Roofs,"Flat Roof Infrared Thermal Imaging--Most Thermographers Don't Survey Flat Roofs http://www.RoofScanIR.com  On this webinar, titled ""Why Don't Most Thermographers  Survey Flat Roofs?"", the question is answered.

Most flat roofs are not scanned with infrared thermal imaging cameras! What's the reason? Greg Stockton and Ben Hixson explore this question. Every thermographer should view this free video.

Greg Stockton is president of Stockton Infrared and United Infrared, as well as RoofScanIR. His companies have surveyed millions of square feet of flat commercial and industrial roofs using infrared thermal imaging.

Ben Hixson is one of the most prominent roofing consultants in the the U.S. and also functions as technical director and an instructor at the Roof Scan IR classes held by United Infrared.

United Infrared, Inc. is the largest network of certified and properly trained flat roof thermographers in the world, having trained hundreds of thermal image camera technicians.

All major camera models are used in the classes and sold by United Infrared, although an infrared camera with a resolution of 320 by 240 pixels is required to get good images in the flat roofing infrared industry. The most common camera used is a FLIR T420 at present, but Testo, Fluke and Palmer-Wahl cameras are also employed by the students.

2yqPs8vbGSg,Thermal Camera Accuracy Day and Night,"Thermal cameras work well at night in clear weather but their performance typically suffers throughout the day, just after sunset and when weather is less optimal.

In the left-hand video for the market-leading camera, the image is blurry and the second person in the image is not reliably detected due to the lack of contrast between the person and the background.

In the right video, the SightSensor not only shows more image detail, the SightSensor also highlights both people in the image reliably.  The image also looks much more natural to the eye.",sightlogix,10/27/2011 18:19,2195,0:00:37,0,0,0,Science & Technology,0,[],thermal camera

rVlpYA91a_w,How To Turn A Biomat Into A Sauna (Infrared Sauna Hack For Blood Flow & Detoxification),"Ben Greenfield from http://www.BenGreenfieldFitness.com/biomat shows you how to turn a infrared biomat into an infrared sauna. You can get a thermal silver blanket at: http://amzn.to/1Hc1wT3

To learn more about all the benefits of heat, saunas, and Biomats, visit http://www.BenGreenfieldFitness.com/hackedsauna

What is a Biomat? The BioMat is a combination of three different technologies: far infrared rays, negative ion effects and the conductive properties of amethyst channels. These three technologies are combined in a single mat that delivers soothing, deep-penetrating heat while simultaneously stimulating the regeneration of damaged cells in your body. It’s a completely safe and natural way to achieve optimal health and maintain a stronger, more resilient body.

All BioMat medical devices are constructed to the highest standards and protected by a 30 Year Limited Warranty plus lifetime trade-in warranty. The product has been subjected to rigorous quality testing and is both a FDA Registered Class II Medical Device and ISO certified.

IHhvaUdWfDI,Thermal Expansion of Water: Demonstration and Explanation,"Many substances expand when heated (e.g air or metal).  Water also expands when heated (note that the thermal expansion of water only begins above four degrees Celsius).

To demonstrate the thermal expansion of water a 750mL plastic bottle is filled with water and a drop of blue food coloring.  A straw is put through the bottle cap and sealed so there are no leaks.  The level of water in the straw is measured and then a lamp with a 100 watt bulb is turned on and directed at the bottle.

Measurements of the water level are taken for two hours to show the thermal expansion of water.  When the light is turned off, the water cools and contracts, returning to its original position.

The thermal expansion of water is one of the primary causes (along with ice melt) of the rising sea levels on earth.  As the global average temperature increases the water in the oceans expands occupying more volume.  This leads to sea level rise.

YFUKtuKUOmE,Best Long range cooled thermal camera,"The M Series cooled MWIR Thermal imaging cameras offer very high sensitivity & high resolution at F4 continuous zoom lenses. The M Series Cooled MWIR thermal FLIR cameras are affordable while giving the user ultra long range standoff imaging performance up to 55 Kilometers.

www.x20.org

Cooled thermal camera lenses are needed for a thermal sensor to fulfill its ultimate purpose. Highly sensitive InSb and MCT sensors are only half of the equation. To truly leverage the power of cooled thermal sensors, you need a good lens. So, what makes a good lens? Like everything of quality in life there is no one data marker that you can point to and say; “oh well if it has that then it must be the best”. Rather, it is a combination of factors that determine a lenses quality. The main specifications of a thermal lens include: the lenses focal length, f/#, coating, alignment with the thermal sensor, size of the thermal sensor, pixel pitch of the thermal sensor, athermalization of the lens and environmental housing. That is a lot of factors. I am sure that you can now see that the question is not “what is the best cooled thermal lens” but “what is the RIGHT thermal lens for my needs”?  So, with all these specifications to juggle how do I know what is the right thermal lens to choose? Lets start by looking at some of these options and figuring out what they mean.

FOCAL LENGTH-  When discussing long range cooled thermal camera lenses, this is going to be the first specification you come across. Quite simply the focal length is the distance from the front of the optic to the point at the back where it focuses the energy that you are imaging. In the world of long range thermal imaging it is generally assumed that a longer focal length is used to see farther distances. A longer focal length will also result in a narrower field of view.  So, with long lenses you can see farther away but you see a narrower area. For example (numbers made up for ease of calculation)  if a 100mm lens could see a person at 1,000 meters and had a horizontal field of view of 15 degrees, then a 1500mm lens could see a person at 15,000 meter but would have a narrow horizontal field of view of only 1 degree. This makes it easy to see far but difficult to track targets closely. That is where the cooled thermal camera ZOOM lens comes in to play.  For long range thermal surveillance, the right lens in this example would be a 100mm-1500mm continuous zoom optic. This type of cooled thermal camera zoom lens provides a 100mm FOV, a 1500mm FOV and every FOV in between.  The thermal zoom lens makes it easy to select the perfect FOV for the target you need to track.

COATING- All cooled thermal camera lenses are coated in order to perform properly and reduce unwanted stray energy.  The basic anti-reflective coating is standard on all thermal lenses and is designed to eliminate that stray energy. Better lenses have whats called a DLC or HDLC coating. The Hard Diamond Like Coating of these lenses protects them from atmospheric pitting and blowing dust. In long range thermal imaging this matters.  The size of these lenses usually means that the lens front element is exposed to the environment in the housing. The shear size of the lens prevents the use of IR transparent windows since they need to be so large and thick to cover the objective lens diameter.  The quality of the coating is the most important thing to keep in mind.

how to change your webcam so it can see in the dark. The CCDs of all digital cameras are responsive to infrared light (IR) as well as visible light. However, most webcams come with a filter installed to block out IR light. This makes the image less washed out but it keeps you from being able to see in the dark (using IR illumination). This intructable shows you how to remove the filter from a ""Creative Live"". Removing the filter from other webcams will probably be a bit easier, but they all follow the same procedure.

unscrew the webcam case, see the screw hole? This webcam (logitech quickcam chat) had only one phillips screw holding it together.

The two halves will come apart and out drops the circuit board with wire/etc attached.

unscrew the lense assembly from the circuit board. When you unscrew this, the CCD (the Charge Coupled Device is an array of photosensors on the green PC board) will be exposed.

Side Note:
I'm not sure but I think maybe the CCD can be harmed if you shine bright light directly at it (without a lense assembly in front of it) so I hid it away under a piece of paper while doing the rest of the steps.

Pull the lense assembly out from the surrounding knobby thing (the blue ring that you turn to adjust the focus)

the IR filter is just a little square piece of glass, pull it out. Then, bend a piece of wire or paper clip or something into a square and put it in to replace the filter (so everything will fit back together correctly afterwards).

Then pop all the layers back on (make sure that thin black circle thing isn't blocking the lense). everything popped back together securely so I didn't use glue or anything.

Then put the lense assembly back into the blue ring thing and screw the whole thing back ontop of the CCD. Screw back the case, you're done.

to test it out, look at your remote control while you click it, you should see the IR LED blink. You can use your remote as a flashlight for the camera in the dark. You can buy IR illuminators or make your own out of a bunch of IR LEDs and voila, you can see in the dark.

Try not to use this for anything creepy.  :)

Thermal Grizzly Conductonaut (Liquid Metal Gallium) Do not place on aluminum 73 w/mk\n2. Coollaboratory Liquid Ultra (Liquid Metal Gallium) Do not place on aluminum  - 38.4 w/mk\n3. Coollaboratory Liquid Pro (Liquid Metal Gallium) Do not place on aluminum 32.6 w/mk\n4. Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut (nonconductive paste) 12.5 w/mk\n5. Gelid GC Extreme (nonconductive paste) 8.5 w/mk\n\nThose are the best. I have seen reviews and videos about coollaboratory liquid metal paste drying up after 3-6 months problems. Suggest if you want to go with the liquid metal paste go with conductonaut and traditional paste, go with thermal grizzly kryonaut or gelid GC Extreme. Back when gelid was out, it was the best. In 2013 i bought IC Diamond thermal paste, it's conductive which is bad and its 4.5 w/mk on the thermal conductivity. Its hard to apply and doesn't do the job right. Its hard to clean. I've tried to clean this stuff up couple times, you cannot clean the surface on the CPU copper TIM, its just not possible with IC Diamond being used. Also reason why i had to reapply so many times was because i couldn't find out why my computer kept having bsods. TL:DR, CPU had problems, and NO... Cpu did not have problems due to the paste, it was just bad out of box. i noticed when i swapped from IC Diamond to artic mx-4 and dude... This was on different days, so this is not a very good simulated test environment to do this but i got 28-29 C i believe with IC Diamond and 26 C with MX-4. Now, for those who read this. Mind you, remember... When i tested it, the days from when i pasted were days if not weeks apart so ambient temps could be different but i really love mx-4 because they say it last 8 years though  i would not trust to repaste every 8 years AND ANDDD its so much easier to clean. I gave my extra leftover to a family member, his notebook had problems with heat issues. He replaced the notebook fan for cpu and repasted. OMG he was so happy, temps were so good, i used IC Diamond on my hp notebook and it was idling at 57 C, and if left on for 20mins it'll go as high as 75 C just browsing the web, fan ramps up hard everytime and lags, I've replaced the thermal pads too with Fuijipoly pads, still does not help. Even repasted couple times with ic diamond. He used Mx-4 and not once did i hear his cpu notebook fan ramp up... Amazing imo... These notebooks were i believe HP Pavillion DV-2045DX and HP G7 i believe. G7 was the family members.\n\nOverall, choose the 5 top ones that i've listed, if you're cheap or maybe you have mx-4 and ic diamond, go with mx-4, its just better imo.""], [u'Dmitri Krasyukov', u""Nice video, but I already re-pasted my ROG G750 laptop including the GPU with Arctic Silver 5 which is bit risky but so far its working fine, that's the only paste they had at my local computer store.

Liquid Ultra (CLU) is rated at 38.4w/mk and Liquid Pro (CLP) is rated at 32.6w/mk, this info comes from the CEO of the company.\n\nHowever, there are two issues with either of them: \n1. It destroys any aluminum, kinda well known thing...\n\n2. AVOID USING IT WITH COPPER TOO (DON'T BELIEVE WHAT MARKETING SAYS)! It \nwill stain copper surfaces so the only way to get it off is to lapp the surface (multiple reports on this). Even worse, if your HSF block is copper (like on many closed loops AIOs), the CLU will cure (dry out) very fast, usually within a month or two of use, and will lead to super high temps/need to reapply. \n\n3. So it can  ONLY be used with nickel surfaces successfully for any \nprolonged periods of time, basically.  In other words, if you're \nde-liding your CPU (winch will void the warranty, for those who don't know, duh) you can use CLU on the die and IHS (integrated heat spreader, or CPU lid) from inside (as it's nickel coated).\n\nBUT, if you're not de-liding and just want to use it like a regular thermal paste - IT'S \nONLY WORTH IT IF YOUR HSF BLOCK IS NICKEL! DON'T USE IT WITH COPPER OR \nALUMINUM! And I repeat, it's is NOT optimized for copper stuff AT ALL! \n\nSo, if you're deliding and use it on silicon and nikel covered IHS - fine.\nIf you're using it outside on the IHS with nickel covered HSF block - fine.\n\nEverything else is a big NO NO.""], [u'CreeDzteP', u""In Argentina Doesn't sell CooLaboratory :(""], [u'piffdaddy420', u'this is fuckin crazy.  i cant believe how big of a difference just from thermal paste.  wow.'], [u'Fistagon777', u""don't see arctic silver on there, is that arctic mx-2?""], [u'Benjamin S\xf8rensen', u'hey mate nice test and I hope you can answer how long you let cool laboratory liquid copper side before test'], [u'Marian Steel', u""I'm curious what will happen when you mix these pastes up and put it on a cpu""], [u'Nino Latif', u'One question tho, the Alienware gtx 1080 with 7820hk.

EA-VCaBUsCA,How to Make a Thermal Lance Kit - Hot Enough To Melt Rock - NightHawkInLight,"I came up with this project in an effort to replicate industrially made thermic (thermal) lances in a small, mobile form factor. Their use commercially is usually for demolition purposes as they have the ability to cut through incredible thicknesses of steel. Both because of the extreme heat they produce as well as their ability to oxidize and burn whatever material they are cutting, in addition to the simple melting action that would be provided by a torch.

I do not recommend you replicate this project without extensive experience with oxygen cutting tools. Pure oxygen is very dangerous and can burn through otherwise fire resistant materials. It should NOT be used without full welding safety equipment.

I want to thank my Patreon supporters for helping me make this video! I go through a lot of materials and project failures as I create designs worth making a  video about. The extra contributions you have provided greatly help, especially for videos that are not sponsored. Your support will help grow my channel to bigger and better things.

-4ohP9h31VU,Finding Bigfoot Vermont Bigfoot Caught on Thermal Camera,"The bigfoot team descends on a Georgia forest with night vision and thermal imaging cameras to find a Sasquatch also. The Patterson–Gimlin film (also known as the Patterson film or the PGF) is a famous short motion picture of an unidentified subject the filmmakers said was a Bigfoot. The footage was shot in 1967, and has since been subjected to many attempts to authenticate or debunk it. Several university based studies and professional evaluations have concluded the subject cannot possibly be a man in an ape suit. However, others have judged it to be a hoax staged with a man in an ape suit.

The footage was filmed alongside Bluff Creek, a tributary of the Klamath River, about 25 logging-road miles northwest of Orleans, California, in Del Norte County. The film site is roughly 38 miles south of Oregon and 18 miles east of the Pacific Ocean.[2] For decades, the exact location of the site was lost, primarily because of re-growth of foliage in the streambed after the flood of 1964. It was rediscovered in 2011.[3][4][5]

The filmmakers were Roger Patterson (February 14, 1933 – January 15, 1972) and Robert ""Bob"" Gimlin (born October 18, 1931). Patterson died of cancer in 1972 and ""maintained right to the end that the creature on the film was real.""[6] Patterson's friend, Gimlin, has always denied being involved in any part of a hoax with Patterson. Gimlin mostly avoided publicly discussing the subject from at least the early 1970s until about 2005 (except for three appearances),[7] when he began giving interviews and appearing at Bigfoot conferences.[8][9]

The film is 23.85 feet long (preceded by 76.15 feet of ""horseback"" footage), has 954 frames,[10] and runs for 59.5 seconds at 16 frames per second. If the film was shot at 18 fps, as Grover Krantz believes,[11] the event lasted 53 seconds. The date was October 20, 1967, according to the filmmakers, although some critics believe it was shot earlier.[12][13][14][15]",Ben Halvorson,3/26/2016 20:02,1546,0:02:27,18,1,4.789473534,Travel & Events,4,"[[u'MFE Vick', u'I think the music and the transition of the different footage shots made this a well made documentary.

For carbon based fuels this equations explain the ineficiency of engines. ""Energy"" is stored in a chemical form then is converted in a thermal form then in kinetic form.

Engines are poor thermal machines but excelent pressure converters. This make explosives better ""fuels"" than gasoline. In fact are used to start some engines. But storage rise bigger problems and manipulation is dangerous also. What if a chemical compound like ammonia nitrate is detonated by spark plug ? How those equations will be written? What other implications ( other that oil industry restructuration) may have conversion of actual engines on this chemistry instead of carbon oxidation ? What if most of this ""fuel"" may be produced onboard in a super efficient close loop?

LcH7FMXB3ts,4K Experimentations: Blackmagic Infrared,"FULL BLOG POST WITH ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW HERE:  http://philipbloom.net/blog/infrared/ ‎

My last infrared experimentations, for now. This time with my dusted off Blackmagic Production Camera which I removed the IR blocker from so it sensitive to light from the while spectrum, visible and invisible infrared. Here I used various screw on filters to cut the visible light. For this I used 650nm and 720nm filters. I also used an R65 Tiffen Red Filter as my 590nm filter has not arrived yet.

Most of the stuff in Brighton is filmed with the 720nm filter as well as a couple of shots with a strong variable ND on and no IR filter. Most of the rest of the shots are with the 650nm filter on a 40mm Canon pancake lens as it was the only lens I had that took the 52mm filter.

Grading is deliberately all over the place. Most of this was shot raw as it gave me much more control over the very important white balance. Some shots have the blue/ red channels reversed to give a blue sky with the 650nm and R65 filter which give a reddy/ brown colour normally.

It was powered by a 12v power adapter and wired using coax cable to a 26"" LCD panel in the garage. This camera will be installed (after repair of front lens) into a 2002 BMW M3 and will send it's information to a 7"" LCD display in the car. Furthest distence from lens tested was about 20 meters. The camera was attached tot he work bench after being wired up and tested for fuction. The temperature outside is 55 degrees, and the video was shot at 11pm EST on October 17th, 2012.

dwRhzerIzmg,Mold Detection with Thermal Imaging,"Sometimes, mold can grow undetected, behind walls following a leak, flood or other moisture intrusion. Prior to infrared inspections, the only way to find out about this mold growth would be to tear up the walls and check. Luckily you don't have to do that anymore, with Mold Busters non-destructive and cost-effective thermal imaging inspections.

Mold can grow virtually anywhere—in any room of any house, in any commercial building and in any storage room.
That said, some areas are more prone to mold problems than others. Knowing where to look for mold can help you detect, eliminate and prevent the problem.
In the following section, we’ll let you know which parts of your house are most vulnerable to mold infestations.
