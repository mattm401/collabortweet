QFt4hJak5SE,FLIR Vue Pro - Unboxing Review - Thermal Imaging Camera for sUAS - 640 19mm,"The FLIR Vue Pro thermal imaging camera is a step many commercial sensor and camera manufacturers have done. A purposefully designed and developed product for aerial applications in small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS). In this unboxing and review I take a closer look at the physical camera as well as its set of features and image quality.

*Full Review*
The full review cannot be posted in the description. Please visit this blog post to read the full review. http://blog.florianuhlemann.de/flir-vue-pro-thermal-imaging-suas/

*Where to Buy*
If you are on the lookout for one of these cameras, feel free to contact John Palmeri at www.oemcameras.com and please mention that you were referred by Florian Uhlemann. He’s a great guy and the sales experience was superb! He also ships internationally, offers a custom-made 35mm f/1.5 lens for the FLIR Vue Pro camera and a great power regulator for the 5V input that is required by the FLIR Vue Pro.

*Technical Details*
The Vue Pro features a 640×512 pixel uncooled VOx microbolometer sensor with six different lens and sensor combinations and a low weight of only 109 grams. There is also a 336×256 pixel sensor available. While the 640 edition offers a selection of 19mm, 13mm and 9mm lenses, the smaller sensor comes paired with either a 13mm, 9mm or 6.8mm lens. The shorter focal length of the 336 edition is used to accommodate for the smaller sensor size to grant roughly the same field-of-view. The lenses are not interchangeable, so you have carefully pick the ideal lens for your job.
With some basic research that you can do, you will find that the Vue Pro is powered by a Texas Instruments IP Video Camera system-on-a-chip, the TMS320DM368, and runs on Linux 2.6.18. This enables FLIR to provide firmware updates and easy MAVLink compatibility.

[... trimmed because of maximum description length ...]

*Final Verdict*
For me this camera has enabled me to actually use thermal imaging technology on my unmanned aerial applications at a rather low-cost factor. With the extremely small size and integrated features, as well as the ability to remotely control the camera, there just doesn’t seem to be an alternative around. The image quality is fairly good, though I’d imagine there could potentially be some improvements in the future. The Vue Pro is packed with rich features, some of which are currently unavailable, such as MAVLink, but in the long run it’s going to be a tremendously helpful little tool for the job at hand. My only nitpicks are going to be the rather slow time interval for still image sequences of 1 frame per second, the requirement to reboot the camera when switching between capture modes and something I haven’t addresses previously: I haven’t been able to find a way to actually use and look at the image data from the FFF still image files. Anything else is pretty good.

o0IzeC-GpLo,How to Re-apply Thermal Paste on a GPU (Nvidia GTX 500 Series),"Disclaimer: This is a tutorial only. I am not liable for any damages cause by you trying this; proceed at your own risk. So don't sue me folks =D

This is my tutorial on how to re-apply thermal paste on a newer generation GTX card by Nvidia. You ATI/Radeon owners should still be able to follow this as the application part should be the same.

As one of the comments noted, AS5 isn't the ideal thermal paste to use. Since it has silver particles in it, AS5 is a conductive paste. If you're not careful, it can lead to damage if it manages to short-out any power connections it gets on. His recommendation of MX-4, as an alternate, is a good one and I'd advise you use it instead of AS5.",Kasun Kulathunga

PQYXTaBur34,Flash Infrared Thermography & NASA Technology Licensing Opportunities,"Researchers at the NASA Johnson Space Center have developed and refined Flash Infrared Thermography as a means of Non Destructive Test Evaluation (NDE). NASA’s innovative technology offers three complementary contrast tools that provide characterization of flaws and anomalies in nonmetallic composite structures using flash infrared thermography. The method can detect smaller flaws, and provide quantitative and qualitative information about the shape, size, depth, and location of anomalies. NASA’s designed methods assist the operator in defining the boundaries of flaws. For industries interested in NDE of composite materials – this technology can be integrated with existing infrared thermography hardware systems.

Are we running so far from facing the numbers who clash in an empty room
for false visions we search and the reflections consume but the mirror is everyone's tomb
what we'll find in the waste of time all these self hating days in the image maze
losing sight of our roots in the empty shells where everyone fights themselves, selves
everyone fights themselves, selves

[Chorus:]
I'm tired of looking out from
BLANK EYES
I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
OUTSIDE
watching gridlock in the window
BLANK EYES
I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
OUTSIDE
another answer for our crimes
and I get so tired of waiting for it
to find the truth in everything rejected
I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
another day between the lines

Rooftop to rooftop screaming out into the sky
we fight the war inside us turning answers into questions
through all this vanity we'll fight 'til soul rebuild
fools gold what we had the symptoms of a world gone mad
the world's lies, the masses cry, children's lives spent sewing up our cheap disquise
losing sight of our roots in the cathode rays amnesia for the end of our days, days
amnesia for the end of our days, days

[Chorus:]
I'm tired of looking out from
BLANK EYES
I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
OUTSIDE
until it's nothing special
BLANK EYES
I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
OUTSIDE
another answer for our crimes
and I get so tired of waiting for it
to find the truth in everything rejected
I get so tired of waiting, tired of waiting
another day between the lines

We're all gone dead what we reject [x3]

Wake up everyone!

Picture illustration on why spread method isn't the best:
http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v176/NYC84/Forum/cbf792db.jpg

I personally use the pea method when mounting the heatsink onto the CPU. Whether the spread method will create air bubbles or not, I would not recommend it. The reason is simply. The base of the heatsink might not be entirely flat and if so, it creates air gaps between the CPU's heat spreader and the heatsink base. The spread method is not able to fill up the air gap.",yaochoon

Infrared Thermography in the Evaluation of Aerospace Composite Materials: Infrared Thermography to Composites provides an update on infrared thermography, a fast and reliable method for non-destructive evaluation of composite materials used in the aerospace field. The book describes composites and the main problems that can arise both during manufacturing and when in service, and then covers different thermographic non-destructive testing and evaluation techniques, including pulse thermography, lock-in thermography, and pulse phase. Each technique includes key examples and relevant references, with sections devoted to the usefulness of an infrared imaging device to monitor the behavior of a material under load, such as impact and bending. The book also includes discussions on standards, personnel certification, and training.provides a comprehensive look at the use of infrared thermography in the materials science fielddescribes thermographic techniques of non-destructive testing in an easy way, and with links to aeronautical standardsaddresses different types of composite problems and how they can be helped through the use of infrared thermographyincludes key examples and relevant references, with sections devoted to the usefulness of an infrared imaging device to monitor the behavior of a material under load",Hoyt Ash

The ground is frozen from the freezing rain we had last night. The transformer takes 14.4KV and steps it down to 240VAC for residential consumption. That's the glowing yellow thing near the center of the screen for about the first minute. Around 76 seconds in, I walked towards the street, looking at the heat given off by the neighbors' houses.

LfNx8heAZ9o,UAV Aerial Thermography with Thermal Imager OPTRIS PI450 Lightweight Kit,"In Vespadrones we genuinely believe that the Optris company presents still the best solution for UAV thermography applications. That´s why we continually try hard to do our best in optimalization of our drones for use with Optris equipment. For example, an infrared camera Optris PI 450 was fully integrated into our hexacopter XYRIS 6 for maximalization of its efficiency. The integration consists mainly in successfull attachment of a Netbox mini computer on the drone from below. The biggest advantage of the whole thing is that because when we don´t have to place the Netbox on a camera gimbal as usually, there is still enough space for e.g. GoPro camera next to the Optris PI 450 camera. Apparently, if we use both infrared and GoPro camera simultaneously, we can also compare the video materials gathered from them.

4uhz1rIaMj0,Infrared Thermography and Building Efficiency - presentation by Matthew Knights of FLIR systems,"Do you have offices that feel drafty, but you just can't figure out where that cold air is coming from? Or maybe your building's HVAC system is consuming a lot more energy than you think it should. Infrared Thermography can help!

Loss of conditioned air from a leaky building envelope can account for a significant amount of energy consumption. Thermal images can help you quickly identify air leakage around windows, doors, attics, vents, and many other places.  These same images can also help you identify insulation deficiencies, water damage, potential mold sources, electrical faults and radiant tubing locations.

Chapman Construction/Design hosted this free seminar to better acquaint attendees with the science of infrared thermography and practical applications in the building industry. Our speaker is Matthew Knights of FLIR Systems, one of the leaders in the design and manufacturing of infrared imaging systems. FLIR provides thermal imaging systems for diverse applications ranging from military and law enforcement to utilities and manufacturing plants.  Their handheld devices that can detect minute differences in temperature, making thermography an efficient, non-destructive way of finding problems in a building.  In addition, Chapman also presents examples of infrared thermography in use on some recent projects.

Registered architects and LEED APs can earn credit toward their professional designations by attending a series of programs offered by Chapman Construction/Design, an approved provider of LEED CMP and AIA CEU courses.",ChapmanConstDesign

p1A5TZP2ukw,Thermography.  Non-invasive scan,"Thermograph is non-invasive rolling scan that takes 2 temperatures of our spine, on each wheel.  These two wheels do a rolling scan of both sides of our vertebrae.  If the temperatures is not the same on both sides, something's off and shows proof of probable subluxation.

When people hear I healed from Eosinophilic Esophogetis, EoE, they want to know what I did.  I changed 9 things in my life.  Below is my list, in order of importance from the most important on down.  This is how I feel I healed out of my rare disease in under 8 years!

1.  Receiving care from an upper cervical chiropractor
2.  Doing weekly yoga with a community
3.  Changing to a plant based diet
4.  Daily using high quality, pharmaceutical grade vitamin and supplementation
5.  Completely removing alcohol and cigarettes from my body
6.  Oil pulling for a healthy mouth and upper G.I.
7.  Avoiding all foaming agents in toothpaste and shaving cream
8.  Developing the ability to drink tonic water
9.  Losing over 30 pounds and getting into cardiovascular exercises

To learn more about Eosinophilic Esophogetis, visit the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology:  http://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/related-conditions/eosinophilic-esophagitis​

My story:  ""Experiencing the diagnosis of a chronic disease does not define me; although adapting my health, wellness, and healing naturally from it may...  This experience started on August 6th, 2008 but did not know, until this year it was defined as chronic.  This rare disease has no known root case, was very unknown then, and still is today.  My intuition tells me that the root cause of this disease plus other rare diseases is not having a proper mind body connection, starting with our top 2 vertebra.  Atlas and Axis

In 2008, my doctors put me on the elimination diet but failed to tell me what I could eat.  This sent me on a major quest.   My mother is our family pharmacist who helped me with natural health - wellness remedies, alongside my mentor, and my intuition:  ""I now know, as of September 2016, that my esophagus is no longer shrinking in diameter!!""

I made this video for 2 reasons.
First I wanted to digitally announce that I healed from a rare disease known as Eosinophilic Esophagitis and launch a playlist.  The second reason is to describe this non invasive thermograph machine to you.  I recommend everyone get the temperature scan -known as a thermograph.  Find a chiropractor who has this machine.  There are different kinds, some read temperature and some read electrical signals.  This video shows a machine that scans temperature.

VfVczCjBO3Q,Monitoring the Health of a Horse's Hoof using Equine Thermography,"veterinary-thermal-imaging.com - An incorrectly balanced foot can have extensive knock-on effects on the leg and back. Imaging the sole of the hoof, and the thermal patterns seen on the hoof wall when weight bearing quickly show whether the hoof is unbalanced. Areas where the hoof wall is longer are under more pressure and friction than the corresponding side and therefore show as a warmer area.

Inside the hoof, early abscess detection is possible, allowing pinpoint accuracy when draining. And Equine Thermography has proved a valuable tool in early research studies into laminitis.

wIZozabAMO8,What is Infrared Light?  William Herschel's Amazing Discovery of Infrared Radiation and Waves - 02,"What is infrared light?  Here we will learn the story of William Herschel and how he completely by accident discovered infrared light.  Infrared Radiation (IR) was unknown in his time, but now we know that the IR spectrum is just a small part of the broader electromagnetic spectrum.

Herschel discovered infrared radiation by measuring the temperature of different parts of the visible light spectrum made by passing sunlight through a prism.  He discovered that just beyond the red part of the spectrum were invisible infrared waves.  Now we know that the definition of infrared light is just longer wavelength waves in the EM spectrum.  We also now know that infrared rays are associated with heat and that the infrared frequency range is just beyond that of the red light in the visible rainbow.

---------------

Hello welcome to smarter in
science we're going to take a few
minutes of your time and learn together
about something truly amazing in the
realm of science.

Today we're going to
talk about the amazing discovery of
infrared radiation.  There's a really cool
story behind infrared radiation and how
it was discovered i'm going to share
that with you today.

The first thing is let's talk a little
bit about what is infrared radiation and
that is basically the type of light in
type of invisible light that we
associate with heat is given off by an
object. so here are a couple of examples
of that here's a space shuttle that's
just coming from the atmosphere it's
gotten very very hot
notice the underside of the ship is kind
of as the reddish colors and the whitest
the whitish color is where the top of
the ship is blue bullish colors.

so what
this means obviously the bottom of the
ship hotter and when something is hotter
it radiates more infrared radiation and
so those why the coat that's why the
colors are red there where is the top of
the ship is not as hot and in this
picture is represented by blue because
it's not radiating as much in the
infrared there on the top of the ship.

here's a picture of a house and you can
see sort of the same thing here most of
the house for instance the the the roof
here is a bluish color that means that
there's not very much heat coming out of
the roof there it's nicely insulated
there but the ridgeline here at the top
of the house the windows the doors
things like that it's very hard to
insulate those so you see the heat coming
through the windows and the doors and
that's why you see the red there because
the heats coming from the inside of the
house out you see that in the infrared.

Ok
as I said before the discovery of how
this radiation behaves and how it was
discovered two stories really really
neat and we're going to talk about that
right now.

So I'd like to introduce you
to somebody if you've never heard of him
he's a famous scientist whose name's
William Herschel lived from 1738 1822.  Now
this picture of our sun is a modern
picture of course Herschel never saw the
Sun as it is in this picture here from
this from a high-powered telescope or
satellite as we see it today.

Basically he spent a great deal of time
studying light from the stars with the
telescope that he used in his day and
what he did one of the things he did was
he was put these filters in front of the
telescope different color filters.

red
filters yellow filters blue filters to a
basically filter the light coming from
the Sun so that he could study in his
telescope and just from the interaction
with the telescope he started to realize
that he thought the red light from the
Sun when he would isolate the red light
seemed to be hotter than the other
colors as he would isolate them with his
filters now this wasn't a scientific
experiment this was just something he
was noticing so he decided to
investigate further.

now even back in Herschel today the
scientists of the time were well aware
that sunlight can be broken down with
composed of a whole host of colors of
the rainbow there and he knew all about
prisms that could do that job.

So he knew
that sunlight was a mixture of all the
colors of the rainbow and he knew that
he could take white light and split it
up into the different colors
violet indigo blue green yellow orange
and red so what he wanted to do with
scientifically see if any of these
colors coming from the Sun actually had
a higher temperature or did they all
behave the same.

So in order to do that
he decided to set up an actual
experiment to test and see if they were
all the same or any of the colors were
hotter or colder than any of the other
ones. now here's what we have a sort of
an artist rendition of him of a personal
in his laboratory and you can see the
sunlight coming in being split by the
prism and form a rainbow down here now.

in 1800 he devised his experiment to see
if the different colors of the rainbow
actually had different temperatures, and along the way he
completely by accident discovered infrared light.",mathtutordvd

How does the hairy cactus save water? How much food will we need to have produced by 2050 to feed the population? How much water does a sycamore tree use every hour?

Dr Tracy Lawson, from our Department of Biological Sciences, answers these questions in her taster lecture, as part of our Experience Day. She discusses the importance of water movement in plants, and how they have adapted in order to retain as much water as possible. Tracy also shows some of the very first images of water use efficiency, pioneered by the University of Essex, and demonstrates how a thermal camera can be used to measure how cool a plant is.

Matthew Louis Mauriello, Leyla Norooz, Jon E Froehlich

Abstract:
The building sector accounts for 41% of primary energy consumption in the US, contributing an increasing portion of the country’s carbon dioxide emissions. With recent sensor improvements and falling costs, auditors are increasingly using thermography—infrared (IR) cameras—to detect thermal defects and analyze building efficiency. Research in automated thermography has grown commensurately, aimed at reducing manual labor and improving thermal models. Though promising, we could find no prior work exploring the professional auditor’s perspectives of thermography or reactions to emerging automation. To address this gap, we present results from two studies: a semi-structured interview with 10 professional energy auditors, which includes design probes of five automated thermography scenarios, and an observational case study of a residential audit. We report on common perspectives, concerns, and benefits related to thermography and summarize reactions to our automated scenarios. Our findings have implications for thermography tool designers as well as researchers working on automated solutions in robotics, computer science, and engineering.

Here is more info direct from Klein's website -- http://www.kleintools.com/catalog/infrared-thermometers/121-dual-laser-infrared-thermometer-0

Klein tools just released this new infrared thermometer to replace the older IR2000 model, and I really like the features that they built into it.

It has ""dual lasers"" for sighting in exactly what you are measuring the temperature reading on, and that helps remove a lot of the guesswork when trying to be as accurate as possible.  They include a ""K-type thermocoupler"" for taking precise temperature readings or those out of the normal IR range, which can be used at the same time as the IR readings, so you can literally monitor two different things at the same time.

They have a standard 1/4-20 tripod mount built into the bottom of the unit, so you can have it aimed at a work surface & it will scan in a stationary position as you free up both hands to keep working.

Infrared thermometers are some of the most useful tools in any garage, and the ability to know exact temperature readings very quickly will not only help you locate problems....it will help ensure that they have been fixed also.

The commercially available thermal imaging cameras still cost well over $1000 because of high production costs and low demand.  Many hobbyists would like to have a cheap thermal imaging camera even if performance is not as good as commercial or military units.  My goal is to build such a camera.

In this video, I am testing one possible approach:  Using a very thin projection screen that is painted with thermochromic liquid crystals.  These liquid crystals change color in the temperature range 77*F to  86*F.  Ideally, the projection screen housing would be heated (or cooled) to 77*F, so that all incident thermal radiation would raise the screen temperature higher than this, and immediately cause a color change.",Applied Science

UDv9FYfK_Ts,MoviTHERM Flash Thermography for Non-Destructive Testing,"MoviTHERM's Flash Thermography solutions allow for non-destructive evaluation of materials. Flash Thermography is often used for defect detection in metals and composites for aerospace materials. A Xenon flash lamp discharges several kilo Joules of energy in about 2 milliseconds and causes the surface of the material to heat up by a few degrees. A thermal camera takes a sequence of images monitoring the cool down behavior of the material. Non-Destructive Test Software then performs a complex analysis of the image sequence and turns differences in the rate of cooling into contrast changes (darker and lighter areas) in the result image or image sequence. An on-screen slider lets the user ""dial"" through different depths to inspect for defects.

In this video Paul Andersen explains how thermal conductivity measures the ability of material to transfer heat from a hot to a cold object.  The thermal conductivity of conductors is high because the heat travels through the delocalized electrons.  Heat can be transferred through insulators using phonons.

""The lepton flavor violation road to new physics"" by Dr. Avelino Vicente (Université de Liège)

Description
The field of lepton flavor violation will live an era of unprecedented developments in the near future, with dedicated experiments in different fronts. The observation of a flavor violating process involving charged leptons would be a clear evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model, thus motivating the great effort in this direction. After a very general introduction to the lepton sector, its properties and open questions, I will review some of the most popular neutrino mass models, describing their characteristic predictions for lepton flavor violation. Finally, I will briefly discuss some topics that have received some attention recently: lepton flavor violation in low-scale seesaw models and lepton flavor violating Higgs decays.

The ideal solution to this problem is the application of thermal camera systems because the hot spots are significantly reflected on the thermal image (termogram) by contract colouring towards the surrounding. In most cases it is not possible or safe to approach the panels with a thermal camera either in the case that the panels are located on sloped roofs or cases where passing between the panels is prevented by various obstacles (plants, roughness of the terrain …). For these reasons, an elegant and efficient solution is the fixation of the Workswell WIRIS on the drone.",Workswell s.r.o.

ZnadfyxnQic,How Far Infrared Technology Works,"Infrared light is a product of heat production. Humans generate waves in the 6-20 micron range. The optimal output range of far infrared sauna emitters is between 5 and 14 microns which is very close to the resonant frequency of a water molecule. This similarity makes sense since our bodies are almost 70% water. This range, sometimes called ""Vital Rays"", appears to have special regenerative effects on the body. Our heater's output is evenly spread around the 9.4 micron point of peak human output. Because the water molecule resonates or vibrates, this vibration causes a release of cellular toxins such as mercury, aluminum, cholesterol and other toxic gases such as sulfur and formaldehyde. The energy output from the far infrared sauna corresponds so closely to the body's radiant energy that our bodies absorb 96% of the energy.",FarNorthWellness

http://www.flir.com/suas/duo/

In this episode, the Roswell Flight Test Crew performs field testing with the FLIR Duo camera, announced at CES 2017 in Las Vegas. The Duo has been developed specifically for use on drones, and combines a visible light camera and a thermal imaging camera in a single unit the size and shape of a GoPro Hero sports camera – making it compatible with a wide range of gimbals and aircraft that are already available in the market. It incorporates a Lepton thermal imaging sensor with a resolution of 160x120 pixels, and the visible light camera records HD video. The crew demonstrates how to use the FLIR SUAS app, available for both Android and iOS devices, to change between the three available color palettes – WhiteHot, HotMetal and Rainbow – and three display options: thermal, visible and picture-in-picture. The demonstration also provides a look at the implementation of FLIR's MSX technology on the Duo. When MSX is enabled, the Duo runs an edge-detection algorithm on the visible light image and then superimposes those edges onto the thermal image, enhancing the user's ability to identify subjects, in spite of the Lepton's low-resolution sensor. The episode concludes with a sample application: a low-altitude roof inspection.",Roswell Flight Test Crew

fW4Nx_kz6RU,Raymarine FLIR Thermal Camera,"Thermal cameras are now well within reach of the trailer boat market with FLIR launching the M132 and M232 thermal imaging cameras. Boatadvice.com.au journalist Dom Wiseman recently got a first-hand look at the units. The M132 is a tilt only option. It points directly ahead and can move only up or down while the M232 is a pan and tilt camera. It can spin 360 degrees in addition to move up and down.
The cost of these units are considerably less than anything previously available with the M132 priced from $3,595 and the M232, $4,995. With the recent reductions in radar it makes the perfect accompaniment and the FLIR units complement the Raymarine Axiom Multi Function Display with a plug and play operation with the addition of a HS-5 switch.

The cameras use infra red to see what's ahead by separating temperature differences down to 0.1 degree allowing boaters to see and identify obstacles. A radar will show you an object but it sometimes takes a little time to establish what exactly you are looking at. The new thermal cameras are useful in direct sunlight, heavy fog/sea mist and of course darkness. You can combine them with radar enabling you to identify wharves, pylons, buoys and of course other boats.

The M232 was designed to be the smallest, lightest and least power consuming infra red thermal camera. It allows vision in 320 x 240 and both units come with a 4X digital zoom allowing fast identifications. The effective operable distance depends on the size of the object but as best we could identify the unit can see a ferry at around 1.3 kilometres while a smaller object like a person in the water is 450 metres.

Boatadvice.com.au got to experience the true capabilities of the thermal units simulating a man overboard scenario at night on Pittwater. As soon as a man overboard situation arises, push the man overboard icon on the Axiom MFD and the camera swings into action automatically panning to the position to locate the heat signature.",BoatAdvice.com.au

For Powerpoint Presentations:-
http://www.slideshare.net/shubhamthakurmech1

A thermal power station is a power plant in which the prime mover is steam driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is condensed in a condenser and recycled to where it was heated; this is known as a Rankine cycle. The greatest variation in the design of thermal power stations is due to the different fossil fuel resources generally used to heat the water. Some prefer to use the term energy center because such facilities convert forms of heat energy into electrical energy.[1] Certain thermal power plants also are designed to produce heat energy for industrial purposes of district heating, or desalination of water, in addition to generating electrical power. Globally, fossil fueled thermal power plants produce a large part of man-made CO2 emissions to the atmosphere, and efforts to reduce these are varied and widespread.

i_Ls35i428k,"Police Investigates Vybz Kartel, Masicka Infrared Music Video | Alkaline After All Still Under Radar","A music video, which has been uploaded on Youtube , entitled Vybz Kartel, Masicka - Infrared (Official video) , has caught the attention of the Jamaica Constabulary Force as well as the Firearms Licensing Authority (FLA).

The video begins by featuring skimpily clad girls on a yacht, before segueing to a scene with other individuals, one dressed in a security guard's uniform in the process of planning what appears to be a robbery with others.

The video also features an armoured truck being robbed with a display of bullets and high-powered weapons, and a security guard being placed in the back of the vehicle, before returning to a beach scene with people having fun.

The Jamaica Observer understands that the FLA is particularly interested in the armoured truck, guns and bullets, and as such has launched an investigation from last Thursday into the matter. It is further understood that the armoured vehicle used in the video has already been located, while sustained efforts are being made to identify the source of the guns.

This is the second video, which, in recent days, has sparked interest from the authorities.

In the Sunday Observer the police confirmed that a top-level investigation had been started into a music video showing individuals smoking ganja, brazenly toting guns, and a scene in which a woman performs explicit sexual acts after disrobing from what seems to be a police uniform.

In addition, there are others in that video dressed in police uniforms.
The video, which features dancehall artiste Alkaline, also shows what appears to be a marked police vehicle.

Deputy Commissioner of Police Clifford Blake, in giving an update, said yesterday that the investigation ordered by Commissioner of Police George Quallo is swiftly progressing.

“Without giving names or the names of places, I can confirm that we have identified the police personnel [in the video] and will be strictly following our well documented internal procedures as we quickly move the investigation forward.

“Further, I can inform that we have ascertained that the vehicle in the video is a police vehicle, and we have also found out which section of the force this marked police vehicle was assigned and will be dealing with that matter also using our internal procedures,” DCP Blake told the Observer.",Amari Deraisx

_A2kakGc4gw,6515 Thermal Imaging Camera with UV leak detection,"New easy to use and highly sensitive Thermal Imaging Camera also features a UV leak detector:

This new hand-held thermal imaging camera from Laser Tools (part number 6515) combines the function of a surface measuring infrared thermometer with real-time thermal imaging. The device translates thermal energy (heat) into visible light (on screen) to enable analysis of a particular object or area. Instead of just getting a figure for the temperature, you get an on-screen image showing the actual temperature differences of a surface. This lets you see the heat so you know exactly where to target the measurement spot. Easily find unseen hot and cold spots for instant troubleshooting.

The Laser 6515 provides fast temperature readings without physically touching the object. It can safely measure hot, hazardous, or hard-to-reach surfaces without contaminating or damaging the object.  A big feature of the Laser unit is the sensitivity of the thermal imagery — it usefully shows component outlines to aid subsequent identification of problem areas or components.

Save images and data for documentation, and download your images quickly via the removable microSD card or connect straight to a PC or laptop.

The Laser 6515 also features a UV leak detector function. For example, detecting leaks in cooling systems and air-conditioning systems when a suitable UV indicator dye is used.

Automotive applications include, inspecting for irregular friction, overheating from mechanical misalignments, binding bearings or brake components, heated seat element malfunctions, checking vehicle heating and air-conditioning systems, engine radiator and thermostat function, exhaust manifolds, injector/cylinder malfunctions, diesel engine glow-plug malfunctions, high resistance in high-current wiring and hot electrical connection issues.

Building, electrical and maintenance applications include, missing, damaged or inadequate insulation, damp/moisture intrusion, radiators and under-floor heating, air-conditioning systems, identification of hot and cold pipework, heat loss from seals, frames or windows, high resistance in high-current wiring and hot electrical connection issues, etc. More details here: http://www.lasertools.co.uk/product/6515",The Tool Connection Limited

dFPfkHkOEEQ,What Happens To Your Body in an Infrared Sauna? | Hannahgram,"If you're looking to up your blood circulation, improve your complexion and give your body a little love after an intense workout session, infrared saunas are a regiment that you should seriously consider adopting.

Infrared saunas emit sunlike rays to heat your body from inside out, using the same tech as found in neonatal units. And while while medical experts are split this practice, infrared saunas have exploded in popularity within the holistic community. In this episode of Hannahgram, Hannah Bronfman stopped by Higher Dose, an infrared spa venue in NYC, to put this trend to a test.
