rAvnMYqj2c0,Night Vision versus Thermal Imaging,"Describes advantages and disadvantages of night vision technologies


Night vision goggles and scopes make images from visible light, just like your eyes. So, their familiar green-cast images provide excellent situational awareness at night. Unfortunately, magnifying the amount of light in an image is only part of the solution to true night vision.

The critical element they don't address is visible image contrast. That's what you really need to be able to see at night. When a target is brighter than its surroundings it has good visual contrast, and is easy to see.

When a target doesn't have good visual contrast you can't distinguish it from its surroundings. No night vision scope can reveal contrast that's just not there.

Thermal cameras see heat, not light. The more heat an object gives off the more thermal contrast it generates, and the easier it is to see.

Everything on Earth gives off heat, and things like people, animals, and car engines lots of heat. So their easy to see, even through camouflage.

Atmospheric conditions, like smoke, rain, or fog, reflect light, making night vision goggles and scopes even less effective. But thermal cameras see through these obscurants and clearly.

Night vision goggles and scopes also need to have the right amount of light to work well. If light levels are too low, like in rural areas and when looking into deep shadows, they won't be able to see anything.

If there's too much light, from street lights, security lights, or car lights, they become over-saturated. Thermal cameras have none of these limitations. That's why airborne law enforcement units and special operations forces around the world choose FLIR when they need to see hard to find targets at night.",2020Tech

4xulzkBOFKI,What is Thermography (thermal imaging),"This video ""What is Thermography"" (What is Thermal Imaging) is a video lecture is an excerpt from  http://bin95.com/IR Online thermography training. The main use for IR thermography is predictive maintenance and nondestructive inspection. IR thermography should be the most used and well know of  types of predictive maintenance technologies, but oddly is the lesser known. Which makes this video and our thermography training that much more important.


IR Thermography is used for nondestructive inspection and testing and predictive maintenance in Electrical Distribution Systems, Mechanical Systems, Structural Systems, Petrochemical Refining, Research & Development to name a few. Some of the main industries thermography training and technology are used in are the power industry, process and manufacturing, medical industry and building/home energy inspections. But IR thermography use, application in various other industries is limited only by one's imagination and creativity. So get http://bin95.com/IR thermography training today.",BIN Industrial Training

KRaYoOe6vYQ,Far Infrared Frequency Demonstration - How Far Infrared Works,"Video provided by www.promolife.com.  This video demonstrates the effects of far infrared.  For more information on FIR and for FIR products, visit http://www.promolife.com.

Far Infrared Heat Therapy is considered one of the most effective methods of whole body therapy for:

    * Pain Relief
    * Increased Circulation
    * Lower Blood Pressure
    * Increase of Energy
    * Toxin Detoxification and Elimination

Far Infrared Heat penetrates deep in the body (approximately two to four inches) and helps expand and dilate peripheral blood vessels. This helps bring relief to muscles and soft tissue injuries through increased circulation and accelerated production of compounds the body makes to heal. The increased blood circulation delivers oxygen-rich blood to injured muscles helping speed up the body's natural recovery process. Users report that Far Infrared therapy (especially a sauna) lowers blood pressure.

Taking your pulse is as simple as holding a finger to your neck or wrist and timing the beats with your watch.

This sensor fits over a fingertip and uses the amount of infrared light reflected by the blood circulating inside to do just that.",Make:

cjYRNnIFZ1g,THERMAL SCOPE COMPARISON,"This is a comparison of commercially availible thermal rifle scopes.  This test was conducted in the worst possible conditions.  July in Texas with humidity in the high 80% range.  In all  the time I have been hunting with thermal this was the worst I have ever seen it perform.  There is a full written review of all these scopes plus the ones without provided video cables.  The reviews were conducted by three unbiased individuals with vayring levels of knowledge base concerning thermals.  Reviewer one is a Marine, Retired FBI Agent, and overseas security contractor with a high level of thermal experience.  Reviewer two is a experienced hunter with some thermal knowledge.  Reviewer three is a Marine, retired Range Master for a large metro Sheriff's department with little to no thermal experience untill this test.  You can find their written reviews at www.lonestarboars.com in the Night Vision/Thermal section.  We will conduct another test this winter to show the scopes at their best.

Fx49t4sv7f0,Stupid Thermal Imaging Tricks,"In this episode, the Roswell Flight Test Crew demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of thermal imaging cameras through a series of simple experiments. These reveal that, contrary to depictions on film and television, thermal imaging cannot be used to see through walls. Indeed, even glass windows are opaque to thermal imaging. They also prove that metal containers reflect the thermal properties of their surroundings rather than the temperature of their contents, and that while thermal imaging sees clearly through smoke, it is not able to penetrate fog. The video also explains how thermal imaging addresses the infrared spectrum in much the same way conventional cameras and the human eye perceive the visible light spectrum.",Roswell Flight Test Crew

esjcnP9Uxdg,Review of FLIR E8 Thermal Camera Features,"http://www.ivytools.com/FLIR-E8-Infrared-Thermal-Imaging-Camera-63903-0303-p/flir-e8.htm

The FLIR E8 thermal camera offers one of the best values in infrared: full 320 x 240 imaging for just $3995. Many cameras in this price range offer just one fourth of the resolution of the the E8. With 76,800 pixels, it has the resolution to isolate even very small areas of concern. And with 0.06 C thermal sensitivity, the FLIR E8 can detect subtle temperature patterns associated with air infiltration, water intrusion, and mechanical friction.

With the incorporated digital camera, the FLIR E8 captures digital and thermal images with every squeeze of the trigger. It can also combine these images live on the screen in what is called MSX dynamic imaging. With MSX the thermal and digital images are combined in real time to reveal the detail of the visible picture without compromising the data of the thermal image. You can read signs, serial numbers, and even see the pattern on the carpet.

The E8 also offers a few features not included on some of its FLIR Ex-Series siblings. In addition to the thermal and MSX views, the E8 includes the popular picture-in-picture format. Also included is an isotherm function, placing a special palette on  an area above or below a user-set temperature. New to the E8 is the option to manually adjust the temperature level and span to better isolate a temperature range of interest.

The FLIR E8 thermal camera comes standard with the extras that a professional needs to make the most of a day's work, including two batteries and an external charger. The flash memory can store up to 500 image sets for recall on the camera or download to your PC or Mac computer. FLIR Tools software allows easy consolidation of recorded images for annotation and production of an inspection report.",Ivy Tools

uXeM6jRk6w8,The infrared explained!,"Ball park numbers, people are about 2 meters tall.

Dimes, 5 pence pieces, or eurocents are all about 1 millimeter thick.   The ratio of 1m to 1 mm is 1000.
If you drop a further factor of 1000 down on mms you get to microns (one millionth of a meter).
The entire visible spectrum have wavlengths of about 0.4 to 0.8 microns.
Turns out thermal cameras are essentially black and white cameras.  They just measure intensity.  However thanks to a neat trick, you can actually estimate the temperature of an object by how much infrared radiation its giving off.

The infrared region in which thermal cameras see is about 1 to 14 microns.  In actuality, thermal cameras break this up into the near, mid and far IR.  So my camera see in the 7-14 micron region.

The problem lies in the white balance settings, which can be a real challenge to get right. However, you can work around this problem by creating a custom camera calibration profile using Adobe's DNG Profile Editor software. The custom profile will let you have the necessary latitude to correct the WB setting in your IR images for further processing.

Thermal Imaging uses a high-resolution digital thermal camera to take a picture of your body's heat and display these patterns in the form of a digital image.

The cells of your body produce heat through their normal function.  Diseased cells, like cancer, usually produce much more heat in their earliest stages of development (before a tumor forms).

Why are small gaps left in between rails?

Hey!! Did you notice that the level of mercury in the thermometer rose when it was placed in hot water? You must be wondering why this happened, right?
It happened because of thermal expansion. Thermal expansion is the tendency of matter to expand on heating. This tendency of expansion can be observed in solids, liquids as well as gases.
Now let us see how this concept of thermal expansion applies to a thermometer. A thermometer usually consists of a narrow tube with a small bulb at its one end. The bulb and a part of the narrow tube is filled with mercury which is liquid at room temperature. Now, when a thermometer is placed in hot water, mercury inside it expands due to thermal expansion and as a result its level rises.

You must be thinking how the gasoline came out of the tank even though it was exactly filled till the brim. Am I right?
Gasoline also expands on heating. So, what happened is that when the tank was filled till the brim, there was no space left in it. Now, when the bike was kept in the sun, the tank became hot which eventually heated the gasoline filled in it. As a result, the gasoline expanded. But since there was no space left in the tank, expansion forced gasoline to come out of the tank.

Do you think that the rails bent because of thermal expansion? If yes, then you are absolutely correct.
A railway track is made up of a number of rails joined to each other. These rails are usually made up of steel. Steel expands on heating and contracts on cooling. When the rails are joined to one another without leaving any space for expansion, the rails bend due to thermal expansion and the train goes off the railway track.
To avoid this, the rails are not joined together firmly. Instead, each rail is connected to the other in such a way that a small gap is left in between them.
These small gaps provide space for easy expansion of the rails which happens during summer as well as due to continuous friction between the train wheels and the rails. Hence, these small gaps prevent the rails from bending, preventing any kind of accidents.

4yCo-pE-tnA,FLIR ONE for iOS Thermal Imaging Camera Demo Video,"The long-awaited 2nd Generation FLIR ONE for iOS is here. Please see our unboxing video to see what's in the box.

This video is a quick overview of the features of the FLIR ONE for iOS thermal imaging camera. It requires an Apple device with a lightning connector. You can download the App for free iTunes.

This camera includes two sets of optics. One set is a standard visual camera, the other is the FLIR Lepton core. This gives you their exclusive MSX image enhancing technology for a fraction of what a traditional thermal camera would cost. It does have its limitations compared to the more robust thermal cameras from FLIR. This will put thermal technology within reach for a lot more people.

Thanks for joining us. Today, we're talking about the FLIR ONE for iOS. It comes with a nice, protective case. Use the lightning connector. You'll notice it has two cameras. One is a visual camera, and one is the Lepton core, or the thermal camera. Why it comes with two cameras on here we'll explain to you in a second. Again, lightning connector. You'll notice we had to take the cover off of this phone because of the fact that it has to sit flush. If you do have a cover, it's not going to be able to fit and get the connector in there. Again, you will have to take the cover off your phone. We've gone and already installed the FLIR ONE app. We go ahead and just turn it on. It's already turned on. Okay, great.
 You'll notice that it has a center spot reading, and you'll notice the outlining edges. That is because this uses something called MSX, which is a FLIR exclusive technology. It takes both the visual image and the thermal image and traces the visual and fills it in with the thermal. You'll see, as we move around, hot spots. You'll see our reflection right there as we go ahead and record this. Those aren't ghosts in the wall. You'll notice you can see even things like a socket or an outlet. If there's any heat going on behind that, you'd be able to see it thermally as well as visually.
 We have the features about the camera and the phone system. Go into settings. You can adjust your emissivity. It has a few different presets. You can change where you save it, change to save the photos. Automatically, it will calibrate, which is a new change from the older unit. The temperature units, you can change to celsius or fahrenheit.
 You can also use different modes. Here are the different color bands. You've got rainbow, lava. This is the hottest. Using what they call an isotherm, you can see the hottest point on the screen very easily. See how it turns red? There isn't anything really cold in here, so unfortunately, it's not going to show any cold, which would show up as a blue. You've got arctic, just a grayscale. You've got the iron, which is the standard way most people look at thermal images. You've got your high contrast, and you've got something called wheel. We're going to go back to iron mode.
 Other things you can do with this, you can record video. Putting it into video mode, hitting the record button, and now it's actually going to be recording a video as we take the shots. You can also put it in panoramic mode and take a panorama of a large environment. I'll stitch it together. You can see it in the portrait mode. For some reason, it blended out the color there, but we'll figure that out later. Then, it also has what's called time lapse mode. You can actually set it to record at certain intervals. In time lapse mode, you can set whether you're recording in seconds or minutes and up to 60 seconds or 60 minutes at a time. You can see how things change over.
 Again, here, we have the FLIR ONE. This is the iOS version. An Android version will be coming shortly, probably another two months. It's now July when we're making this video, so we'll make up a new one later on. If you have any questions, feel free to give us a call or shoot us an email or visit our website at tequipment.net. Thanks very much. Have a great day.",TEquipment.NET

How do you know where there may be an electrical problem in a wall, or where your HVAC system has a leak? Used by professionals, a thermal imager can put you on the right track. People think thermal imaging is something for the military, police, and high end contractors, and some military thermal imaging gear can cost up to fifty thousand dollars. Innovations and advancements in infrared sensing technologies have made these cameras affordable and accessible to the average homeowner today. The Seek Compact is a small, lightweight camera that plugs directly into your iOS or Android device and uses a free app to turn it into a powerful thermal imager. The Seek Compact is also useful for camping, night applications, and other uses. Now homeowners have a versatile tool that opens up a whole new world of detection for a safe and efficient home.

Board Certified Ohio State Board of Colleges and Schools (Reg # 00-01-1528T)


Studies show that Infrared Saunas promote detoxification, elimination of heavy metals, fats, toxins, substances from food processing, free fatty acids and excess sodium associated with hypertension and uric acid.

Difference between infrared sauna & traditional saunas: Infrared Sauna uses infrared heaters to emit infrared radiant heat, which is absorbed directly into the human body, unlike traditional saunas which heat the body directly via air or steam.

Benefits of Far Infrared Sauna:
• Pain Relief: Infrared energy can penetrate up to 1.5″ deep into connective tissue. The heat relieves pain by expanding blood vessels & increasing circulation.
• Weight Control: Sweating consumes calories, increases heart rate, cardiac output and metabolic rate. It also decreases body cellulite!
• Detoxification: The body eliminates most toxins by sweating. Infrared heat therapy stimulates the sweat glands that cleanse & detoxify the skin.
• Reduces Stress, Promotes Relaxation: Infrared heat relaxes the body & softens connective tissue.
• Great for Skin: Improves circulation, removes dirt, chemicals & dead cells on the surface of the skin.
• Far Infrared Sauna promotes incredible detoxing. The Far Infrared sauna is recognized by Health Practitioners as the most effective way of removing both chemical and heavy metal toxins from the body. ""The Far Infrared Sauna is the safest, most efficacious and economical way of depurating stored toxins...",holistichealthnow

Sure, we didn't actually do a lot of research before we made this video, but HEY. LIVE AND LEARN, RIGHT?

I get just as excited as the next gear queer when it comes to night vision and the ability to see in the dark. However, my wallet can not seem to get past the cost of most of these cool toys. The FLIR scout that I show in this video is a good example. It's small and packable, it works as advertised, but the cost is just not for the ordinary joe. So I'll most likely keep to my high power flashlights and a quick trigger finger when I hunt at night.",TexasNative00 - Page

FfUCMiLqryY,INFRARED PHOTOGRAPHY TUTORIAL - With Color & Glow,"Here's a tutorial for all photographers wanting to make images with a different look and feel. Ray Scott shows you how to create pictures that mimic the look of infrared film. He starts in Photoshop CS6 by converting a RAW digital file into black and white and then takes you through various other steps like duplicating layers, using gaussian blur and the multiply blend mode to achieve the desired effect.
This tutorial is the follow up to a previously released photography tutorial on how to create a B&W infrared effect in Photoshop.

When in studio or in the field Ray uses Canon gear. This is a choice he made years ago knowing that he was buying into a system that he could grow into. His go to camera is the Canon EOS 6D with the second camera being a Canon 5D. Lenses used are all L series f/4  except for the 50mm macro with extender. 16-35mm f/4L, 24-105mm f/4L, and 70-200mm f/4L round out the kit which is carried about with either a Lowepro Urban Reporter 250 messenger bag for city shooting or a Lowepro Sling Bag for landscape field work. While Ray does more camera handholding than before due to the image stabilization capabilities  of his various lenses, he still is a believer in using his Manfrotto carbon fibre tripod. It's light and it is sturdy.

Ray is a firm believer in exposing himself to as much photography and its history as possible. By looking at other people's photos, he has gained a big appreciation of what this medium has to offer. Ray doesn't think that ""copying"" someone else's style is a good thing but rather feels that exposing oneself to others work can work as a teaching and inspirational tool. With this in mind, Ray has amassed a list of favorite photographers that he uses for inspiration. Some of these artistic photographers are Galen Rowell, Ansel Adams, Frans Lanting, Annie Leibovitz, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Capa, Freeman Patterson, William Neill and Richard Avedon.

One of the playlists on this channel is called ""neighbourhood photographer"" which covers tutorials shot in urban and suburban areas. It's always a challenge to see different things of interest when you've been to an area many times yet this is the best way to create good images. You need to return to familiar locations many times. To do so, Ray often drives by car to an area but when he really wants to cover ground yet see things more clearly, he uses his bicycle…bike…and explores the given place.

Whether shooting landscape, macro, portrait or abstract images, Ray always tries to be aware of his surroundings to capture the best pictures possible. Part of this workflow means he is very aware of composition and uses various tips, such as the rule of thirds, as a good starting point in composing. He also likes to break rules from time to time to add new effects to his photos. Being aware of angles, shadows, shapes, lines, textures, patterns and colours goes a long way to making good pictures. He is also a big believer in ""getting out there"" and shooting as much as possible as it is the only way to improve and flex one's imagination. His message is it doesn't matter if you do your photography in the city, suburbs country, mountains or by the sea, just make sure you do it and follow your artistic passion.

If you have never seen Infrared Photography before then come and feast your senses. Capturing the light normally invisible to human eyes opens up a world of creative possibilities that would otherwise not exist.

Watch part one on capturing the image. http://www.firstmanphotography.com/tutorials/infrared-photography-part-1

To shoot infrared photography you do not need a special type of converted camera. The only requirement is a small investment in an infrared filter that will attach to your current lens. These filters remove all the colours of the spectrum apart from the wavelengths at the extreme red end which includes infrared. I recommend the Hoya R72 Infrared Filter and this can be purchased for between £30 and £90 depending on the size of your lens, see the link below. The only drawback with this filter is it lets only a small amount of light through so to properly expose an image it will require a long exposure. Whilst this makes portraits tricky there are still endless possibilities in the realm of landscapes and cityscapes and there are not many photographers out there doing it. Just check Flickr to confirm this.

The characteristics of infrared light differ from that of 'normal' white light we are used to experiencing everyday. For example, green foliage such as grass and trees reflect a large amount of infrared light meaning they will be very bright in your final processed image. This is known as the 'Wood Effect' named after Robert W. Wood who pioneered Infrared photography. It is caused by the transparency of chlorophyll to infrared light allowing the light to pass through into the cells of the plants and be reflected back again. Viewed normally, chlorophyll will reflect all the green light back giving leaves and grass it's green appearance.

Capturing infrared photography in this way requires a long exposure. Please see the long exposure tutorial here:

X_SbeFHUJos,DIY Infrared Illuminators,"This research/testing was done as part of my vehicle night vision project (similar to Mercedes Active IR 'Night View Assist') although it might also be of interest for ghost hunters and security professionals.

In this video I tested a number of different bulbs to see how well they work as infrared (IR) illuminators.

I tested the following:

2 x 4 WATT IR LED illuminators (Classic CCTV IR Illuminators)

5 WATT ""HOUSE"" WHITE LED BULB

8 WATT CFL

120 WATT INCANDESCENT (PAR38)

40 WATT (ESTIMATED) HALOGEN CAR HEADLIGHT BULB

I wasn't able to test the 300 Watt halogen flood light because the light was damaged.

I placed each bulb inside a aluminium foil coated box which had an IR pass filter (3mm Acrylic/Perspex IR Pass Filter) on the front. This lets infrared pass through but blocks the visible light. The camera also had an IR pass filter in front of it to ensure it was only picking up IR light. The camera is a low lux CCTV cam with 1/2"" sensor/lens (Baxall CDX9742/LV).

A brightness threshold was set on the camera which turns overly bright areas to black (to avoid the auto iris adjusting). So if you spot areas that turn from bright to black, that's why. You can also see the camera making some minor brightness adjustments (auto iris / shutter speed) depending on how much IR it was picking up. I think I could easily trade some noise for more brightness.

If you have a good budget and live in a country with easy access to high power IR LEDs, they're probably the best choice. But it can be difficult and expensive to get enough IR LEDs to flood an area. On the other hand, a 120 Watt incandescent bulb is pretty cheap (3-5 USD) and floods an area with IR light very well. With an IR pass filter in front of the bulb, only a faint red glow can be seen.

When swapping from visible light to IR only, the camera needed significant refocussing. That's why I did additional clips with the camera refocussed.

Moving forward, my interest is in cheap LED projector headlights that are sold for motorbikes. They're around 15-20 USD a piece. They're great little units since they already have power management built in, the cases act as heat sinks and the projection lens is already designed for throwing out light in a beam useful to a driver. I just need to source some appropriate IR LEDs to swap into them since they come by default with a 10 watt white LED.",Gadget Addict
