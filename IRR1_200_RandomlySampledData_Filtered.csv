Thermal Expansion

Almost all the substances (solids, liquids and gases)expand on heating and contract on cooling.Few exceptions are; water from 0Â°C, silver iodide from 80Â°C to 141Â°C and silica below- 80Â°C which contract on heating and expand on cooling.The expansion of a substance on heating is called the thermal expansion of substance.

622Q3U63BYU,Scott Sight thermal imaging mask | firefighting,"How the world's first in-built thermal imaging camera could saving firefighters' lives.
Smoke causes more fire deaths than flames, according to the National Fire Protection Association, because people are incapacitated by fumes so quickly that they can't get to safety.
And it leaves firefighters blind, because it's impossible to see anything in a smoke-filled room.
That's why firefighting teams use special cameras that allow them to see through the smoke, rendering images based on heat rather than light.
They've been around for decades, but they've always had one crucial flaw.

bcc3Gc-2yU8,Lepton,"A lepton is an elementary, half-integer spin particle that does not undergo strong interactions, but is subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. The best known of all leptons is the electron, which is directly tied to all chemical properties. Two main classes of leptons exist: charged leptons, and neutral leptons. Charged leptons can combine with other particles to form various composite particles such as atoms and positronium, while neutrinos rarely interact with anything, and are consequently rarely observed.
There are six types of leptons, known as flavours, forming three generations. The first generation is the electronic leptons, comprising the electron and electron neutrino (Î½

TLDW: Super super tiny RDA, with a super super tiny deck. Very tight airflow and not as good of a flavor as I had expected from such a small RDA.  This Lepton while made well, does not appeal to me on any level.

Thank you. I have a question: There are always two ratings for a thermal fuse. e.g: 115 degree 2A @ 250V. Does this mean, the fuse will blow EITHER the temperature exceeds 115 Degree or the current exceeds 2A? It is not that both conditions must be present before the fuse blows right?

This might short out a track of one of the ASICs or even load it up with a LOT of capacitance while it tries to drive the whole heatsink up to a few GHz. This could be why the potted inductor that you are saying is so hot is glowing nicely. The ASIC\'s psu is working very hard. These heatsink ""spreaders"" on pc mobos must always be insulated so as to never make contact with the tracks BGA etc. Even if it is not direct contact the increase in capacitance at high frequencies is not something you want.'], [u'Benjamin Esposti', u""Check the MOSFET transistors (marked Qxxx ... the larger ones not the SOT23, etc... sized ones) near the inductor. One or more of them could be bad, and/or is not being driven correctly, which could cause issues. Also, check the black SMD tantalum/polymer capacitors, those usually are rated for only like 2000 hours at max operating conditions! Toshiba had some issues with these in some laptops, they'd go bad and cause the laptop to crash/freeze, could also cause an issue with the VRM itself.""], [u'icpart BG', u'Hot air gun is useless on that Huge inductor becuase it have large thermal mass. Also under it maybe is large multilayer PCB plate and thermal vias that and need more heat for desoldering that component. For successful reflow Martin you need to preheat pcb under it. I think IR BGA rework station is better for desoldering of that big inductor.'], [u'abbtech', u'As others have indicated it looks to be an inductor, at 12:10 I think I can make out L2 on the PCB silkscreen just between C13 and C14. I have the larger BFL miner and I was quite sure that they originally had a lifetime warranty.

It's function is to form a buck-converter with the mosfets along it. It generates the VCore-supply for one of the ASIC-chips, which has failed. Probably that thermal tape wasn't good enough, and now the chip is dead. Heat transfer compound is always better.

Does the unit keep running if the fan is separately powered? The inductor/circuit getting hot may not be the faulty one, it might be the cooler one which is actually the one playing up. Check for any surface mount fuses, usually marked F1/F2 etc. Get a jewelers glass and have a real good look at all the solder joints. The fan may be temperature activated, try warming the unit up with a hair dryer/heat gun to test. Good luck.'], [u'Peter C. Kopp', u'Looks like a inductor or a transformer to me.

With hot gun you must be extremly carefull or you kill pcb. BTW good luck with repair. \xa0""], [u'Kris Ankers', u'Looks like there is a short on the rail that inductor or transformer is for. Maybe a bad tantalum capacitor or much worse the actual asic. Most probably what destroyed the old PSU. It could be the component is a transformer being used as the gate drive to the switching FETs.

They may be polymer capacitors though, in packages that look like tantalum.\n\nI would also check for datasheets for those mosfets to the right of the inductor (as seen at @12:12 because one or several of those may be shorted and indirectly heat up the inductor through the pcb.\n\nI think some of them are PH7030L made by NXP (search Digikey.com for them) and the others are probably Infineon BSC010NE2LS or another very similar ""model"" made by Infineon (again search Digikey for the model code)\n\n\nps. Electrodacus may be right. What you could also do is remove the heatsink and get some air spray and flip it and spray the whole board until you get ice on it and then plug it in. See which IC melts the fastest - you may see one of the ASICs melt first and that could tell you the asic is overloading the voltage regulator.\nYou could also desolder the inductor and wire it off the board so that you could measure the current going through it - if you have some ridiculous current, it may be obvious the voltage regulator is overloaded by something after the inductor.'], [u'Todd Harrison', u""MJ, I got my smd hot air rework station at Circuit Specialists.

If the problem doesn't follow the inductor than it will be one of the other parts and maybe the voltages will help figure out which component is not performing.""], [u'Skip Tabor', u""Agreed, that is def a coil craft inductor that is part of (most likely) the switch mode supply (buck converter?) I kind of doubt that the inductor is the cause of your troubles, it's temperature is more likely a result of an issue with the power supply. The Qs around the inductor are two different types of mosfets. I bet some of those have failed. Probe the gates like (I wish I could type his name said) and also check if the gate, drain or source are shorted the one another.""], [u'electrodacus', u""Martin,\nI can be wrong but based on what I've seen it seems that one of the ASIC's is dead. The part that heats up is an inductor but that is fine the problem is in my opinion the failed ASIC that overloads that part of the power supply.\nThat explains why you get just half the performance and probably why the original AC adapter failed.""], [u'MrCircuitMatt', u""The C on the chip is the logo of coilcraft. My best guess is that it is a xx611PYA451MSZ. You can check the dimensions here: http://www.coilcraft-cps.com/pdf/cps_catalog.pdf on page 19 to gain some more confidence. Note that this is just an inductor, two terminals, not four. Maybe what appeared like 4 pads were just 2 long pads? That part of the board clearly is a switch mode supply (large caps, inductors, and what appears to be controller chips and MOSFET switches), so no surprise it's an inductor.\n\nRegards\nMatt""], [u'Dan Frederiksen', u""Those blocks are either inductors or transformers. The 6 chips below are transistors based on the Q text on the pcb. The 7030L is a FET by NXP or Fairchild, the 010NE2LI is a FET by Infineon but I wonder if they could be grey market fakes.\xa0\nMust be a switchmode power supply for something but not sure why they have so many transistors.\nIf you could rig a smaller heatsink so you can power it up where you can look at the board from above with the thermal imager you can see more clearly what gets hot. I'm not sure it was the block you point to. I think it is the transistors.\nHave you firmware modified your E4 to 320x240 resolution? If you haven't that would be a big help to do. And I strongly recommend switching off that gimmicky Flir MSX business. It misrepresents the location of the heat when the target is close because the cameras are not at the same height.

BvfABFaiBVo,M3 Infrared Sniper Carbine at RIA,"Sold for $5,750.

The first US military night vision system used in active combat was the T3 Carbine system - an infrared light-amplifying scope and IR floodlight mounted on an M1 Carbine. About 150 of these were used on Okinawa, and were quite effective. The system was refined over time, and by the Korean War this version was in service.

The M3 scope here has a longer effective range (125 yards), and still required the user to carry a heavy backpack-mounted battery pack to power the scope and light. They were used primarily in static defensive positions in Korea to locate troops attempting to infiltrate in darkness. In total, about 20,000 sets were made before they became obsolete, and were surplussed to the public.

By this I mean, for the metallic particles to fill those gaps between the chip and cooler, they would have to be finer and smaller than the gaps between the coolor and what you're trying to cool. With how thick thermal paste is, you also have to consider that the particles are covered in paste. Personally, I've had better results with thinner pastes such as EVGA Freeze than Arctic Silver 5 due to the thinner paste being able to flow into the crevices. \n\nWhile speaking about the thickness of pastes, another factor to consider is the shape of particles and what they're made of. If a paste is full of particles that are polygonal in nature cannot realistically fill gaps very well. While in theory fit together like a puzzle and be able to have zero gaps in between, that doesn't happen. Especially when suspended in a thick solution where they cannot flow into place. \n\nPerhaps it would be interesting to multiple types of thermal compound on an atomic level to see what's really going on.

fq57yNC_lqs,Tendon and Ligament Injuries in Horses Identified Using Equine Thermography,"veterinary-thermal-imaging.com - Equine Thermography is invaluable in detecting lesions in ligaments and tendons, and as an aid to optimising recovery time, and getting your horse back to work as soon as possible and practicable. But, there may be problems brewing even before you can see or feel anything.

Studies in horses have shown that Equine Thermography can detect tendon and ligament injuries up to three weeks before the horse would demonstrate any clinical symptoms.

When bringing a performance horse back into work, commencing fitness programmes, or resuming jumping after a break in the season, Equine Thermography is an indispensible tool in ensuring early detection of problems.

Infrared Photography is a way to make unique photos, you can either convert your camera to a dedicated IR Camera or you can buy a inexpensive IR Filter.

In this tutorial im going to show you a fast way to make IR Photos. I think The IR Pictures looks best when there is a little color to it so im going to show how to edit in Photoshop with channel mixer and and also some raw edeting before opening the IR Photo.

If you have never seen Infrared Photography before then come and feast your senses. Capturing the light normally invisible to human eyes opens up a world of creative possibilities that would otherwise not exist. 

This video tutorial is split into two parts with the first part showing you how to capture the raw infrared image whilst on location. The second part will guide through the post processing where we bring our plain red image to life.

See part 2 here - https://www.firstmanphotography.com/tutorials/edit-infrared-photos

To shoot infrared photography you do not need a special type of converted camera. The only requirement is a small investment in an infrared filter that will attach to your current lens. These filters remove all the colours of the spectrum apart from the wavelengths at the extreme red end which includes infrared. I recommend the Hoya R72 Infrared Filter and this can be purchased for between Â£30 and Â£90 depending on the size of your lens, see the link below. The only drawback with this filter is it lets only a small amount of light through so to properly expose an image it will require a long exposure. Whilst this makes portraits tricky there are still endless possibilities in the realm of landscapes and cityscapes and there are not many photographers out there doing it. Just check Flickr to confirm this. 

The characteristics of infrared light differ from that of 'normal' white light we are used to experiencing everyday. For example, green foliage such as grass and trees reflect a large amount of infrared light meaning they will be very bright in your final processed image. This is known as the 'Wood Effect' named after Robert W. Wood who pioneered #Infrared photography. It is caused by the transparency of chlorophyll to infrared light allowing the light to pass through into the cells of the plants and be reflected back again. Viewed normally, chlorophyll will reflect all the green light back giving leaves and grass it's green appearance. 

Capturing infrared photography in this way requires a long exposure. Please see the long exposure tutorial here:

http://www.firstmanphotography.com/tutorials/long-exposure-photography-tutorial

The infrared photography image captured by the camera will be very red and require some careful post-processing. The second part on how to post-process the images is available now at https://youtu.be/z2QnwnhG9aI

Take a look at Snapon's brand new thermal imager.  I got to play around with it for a few hours and let me tell you its awesome!!",The Snap-On Tool Review,10/28/2016 19:00,8527,0:10:15,102,3,4.885714054,Autos & Vehicles,38,"[[u'Louis Schweigman', u'Great vid,thanks'], [u'Jason Cushion', u'Mine is on order. Thanks for the review!!!'], [u'Victor Bennett', u'Been shopping for two months and the vid helps me - so many avenues and prices but trying to stay 1200 and under, thanks for your time.'], [u'Jason607', u""I just bought one.  I so far give it 3/5 stars.  Price was good and the range is similar to the Flir E40.  I like the E4 from Flir because of the picture overlay but the range of tempratures isn't ideal for an automotive application.  The only thing I really don't like about it is the time it takes to recalibrate.  Every time I move it, it has to recalibrate.   If it did the visual image overlay it would be ideal for all applications.""], [u'donny0007', u'Git one this week. My dealer gave it to me for $1100. He bought six and got a good deal that he passed on. Awesome tool!!'], [u'Jeff Clark', u""FLIR tg 130 dose the same thang for around 200$. I bought the FLIR one it has 9 different color patterns and it take videos and it over lays the true image with the thermal so it is a much better picture it is only 250$ for iPhone or android \n\nDon't not wast your hard earned money on there's The pre-taking photos are useless""], [u'Luis Espinoza', u'First and most important Great Video , Now my opinion it takes Money to Make Money , This Item is Bad Ass I purchased one and it took all the guessing away from Diagnosing Squeaking Sounds From Drive Belts to Pulleys to Suspension and Steering to Engine Performance , Having a Good Reputation with Diagnosing is not cheap but once you establish that ( Good Reputation ) The Money just flows in .'], [u'atimmons31', u""My Snap-on dealer demonstrated one of these to me & said I could get one for $ 1,000 if I acted fast. So I couldn't resist. He is even letting me make weekly payments interest free.     ( nice guy ) I was testing it inside my house & noticed an unknown heat source. I found out that my girlfriend had an unused, but plugged in computer back-up battery that was putting out 107 degrees F. I unplugged it. Who knows ? Maybe this thing saved our house from burning down ! That alone is worth the money to me.

My electronic 3/4"" torque wrench came in, so when I went to pick it up my dealer showed me one, it was just too cool not to have. I spent like $3900 on that visit, the torque wrench was only $1350 so that was a good year end spend. Then I found out it wouldn\'t fit in my tool box like my standard 3/4"" torque wrench, so next year I get to buy new tool boxes. I currently have 2 of the 50"" silverado edition boxes, one with a top box and one with a hutch and four lockers. So I will be going to the 69"" boxes, trading everything in to get black boxes with gold trim. I\'m looking at some ""Fathead"" decals to make a Pittsburgh Steelers box.

I too was impressed with this unit from snap on but the warranty sucked. 90 days and 1400. Dollars.  I purchased the flir TG165 off Amazon new for 380 with tax. Drop safe at about 6ft and very heavy duty product. The warranty is 2years/10 years. Comes with an sd card, cable and charger. Every diagnosticians tool box should have a thermal imager at there disposal. Everything from bearings to electrical problems. Great for tracking down battery drains. Thanks for sharing your quick review of the EETH300.'], [u'sonsautomotive', u'i have one but only for a few weeks and i like it alot...my dealer had it on sale for $995.00 usd...i have not used any other thermal imager so i have not any other imager to reference...i have found bad battery cables over 350 degrees f...bad alternator with diode problems...over 400 degrees f....i have found it is really great for electrical work also found poor radiator flow thru a slow responding thermostat.... thermal imagers in general are a great diagnostic tool for automotive repair....but as always snappy has to be OVERPRICED!!!'], [u'Eddie Da Silva', u'I tryed one out last week not to impressed \nthe resolution sucked\nkept getting this message (updating)\nthere over USD$1000\nI would recommend waiting a couple years till the price comes down and other manufacturers start producing them because they definitely have a purpose just not worth $1100'], [u'Conor Cousins', u'typical snap on..over priced to fuck..think ill wait till aldi or lidl make one'], [u'THE_GAMEING', u'hey man great content im 16 and looking into getting into the trade i appreciate the revievs hopefully a few snap on tools for cristmas!and any tips for getting into the trade??'], [u'Benny CompTech', u""Fuuuck $1400 dollars that's a lot at first I was like I want then I was like nah I'm good I'll stick with my S-O temp gun""], [u'Abraham Puente', u'Amateur hour with this review'], [u'Thomas Hitchcock', u""I'm in need of a oil filter socket for a newer Toyota camry's you wouldn't happen to have the blue point set would you?""], [u'Darren Frost', u'i am from ver the big pond in the uk , i will be purchasing this item in next few weeks , look forward to using it , great review too , keep up the vids ,'], [u'Will Robinson', u'holy shit thats awesome proper game changer'], [u'Ronald Fitzsimmons', u'i was looking forward to seeing this in real world situations but after seeing this video the image resolution and refresh looks a little on the low side for my money i think i will look at the flir E4'], [u'm symko', u'how about showing  the actual specs. of the unit.  so we can compare it to some other units?  Flir has 3 diffrent     models for less than  this one. or at least showing us some practical applications.  does the camera  show the heat on the seat well before you can feel it with your hand?  what about overheated bearings or dragging brake calipers or poor electrical  connections?'], [u'thomas bedenek', u'hope it will be going on sale soon i would love to get my hands on one.'], [u'John Gibson', u""That is great tool, I wonder how it would compare to the 200 dollar ones you can get for the iPhone's. That obviously has other features that the cheap one won't. Someday all firefighters will have one of these built into their helmet or mask. I was first exposed to these in the US navy but they were very bulky but still cool. Thanks to your snap on man for letting you show us this great device.

L95Lilzf6yQ,Myth Busting With Infrared: Ft. Physics Girl,"SUBSCRIBE!: http://bit.ly/1G97GmA

Did you ever leave the front door open in the summer as a kid? Did you dad ever tell you that â€œwe not air conditioning that whole neighborâ€ ? And he probably said all super-dad-like, throwing his hand in the air slightly and then lost focus to talk to your mom about why Christmas at your grandparents house this year just isnâ€™t a good idea!

Well, if that ever happened to you, today were gonna set the record straight and do a little experiment to see exactly how fast all that AC was just rushing out the front of the house. 

Were also going to test how fast cold air leaves your car and your fridge. Because you donâ€™t want to refrigerate the whole living room now do ya!?

But how would we do something like that? 

We would need a special camera, like one that sees in temperature. And thatâ€™s exactly what we have with us today. We have the FLIR camera that sees in thermal infrared. 

So before we get started on this experiment letâ€™s talk really quickly about what infrared is and how these camera work. 

Infrared is a type of radiation that is between the visible and microwaves portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This means that infrared wavelengths are longer than visible light but shorter than microwaves. 

One of the things infrared is used for is to measure the heat radiated by different object. All objects, even ones that you would think of as cold, like an ice cubes produce infrared radiation. This is the type of radiation that is given off by the motion of atoms and molecules in an object, and all objects have atoms that are moving inside of them unless they are at absolute zero. This is a state of no atoms moving which occurs at -459.67F. Any object that has motion of atoms will have a temperature above absolute zero and therefore, will be emitting infrared radiation. 

Some objects are super hot and we can see they are hot like the lava that took out Anakin Skywalker. Other objects are very hot, like the oven top your parents told you not to touch, but you went ahead and touched anyways and got a super big blister. 
These types of objects are hot, but are not hot enough to emit visible light. This is where an infrared detecting device can come in handy, and thatâ€™s exactly what infrared cameras do!

Infrared cameras work by detecting all of that infrared energy being emitted by objects and converting it into an electronic signal. This signal is then processed to make a thermal image which looks exactly like the image that the predator uses to track down Arnold in the Jungleâ€¦ and then again to take out aliensâ€¦ but seriously how disappointing was Predator Vs Alien, I mean it turned into a love story for god sakes!

In a similar way to how if you open a hot oven, the element will turn back on to maintain heat. Since the Fridge or AC are now sharing a pool of air with a larger area, they will not be satisfied until that entire area is cooled. Otherwise you could leave the fridge door open all the time.

But air isn\'t mostly water. If they wanted to get close to measuring the temperature of the air with the FLIR, they should have measured something with the least thermal mass as possible. (a thin piece of plastic comes to mind)\nBy focusing on the objects with relatively high thermal mass, they\'ve missed their mark of  ""air conditioning the neighborhood"" or ""refrigerating the whole house""... Because, if you measure the temperature of an object with relatively high thermal mass, you would need to measure it over a much longer period of time to discover its thermal reactance. The money spent to cool the air that in turn cools the objects is lost when doors are left open - otherwise, why have the doors in the first place. - Sounds silly right?

Remember that the compressor cools the coils / air to -5C to -40C (freezer) which then takes the heat from the air which then has to take the heat from the objects - very indirect and slow.  If you measure the energy used by a fridge during 12 ""daytime"" hours and compare that to the ""nighttime"" when it\'s not being opened you\'ll find that opening the door even very little (no kids or teens), averaged over several days, results in an extra 7% (ambient is 20C) to 30% (30C) increase in energy consumption.  In a more typical home I\'d expect those figures to double - so that about 1/2 of the energy use is due to opening the door and letting hot air in.  Chest fridges/freezers are much more efficient because of this.\nOther people incorrectly ballpark this by looking at the thermal mass of the air - but you can\'t outwit an energy meter.'], [u'William Pereira Gomes', u'i like looking at the person who is not talking'], [u'Seegal Galguntijak', u'Refrigerators, as well as air conditioning works by cooling the air which then cools the objects around them. Even more so in American fridges that actually have a fan to move the air inside around (most European fridges don\'t, they have just a ""radiator"" in the back - only that it doesn\'t radiate heat, but the other way around, it picks up heat from the air). That said, leaving those doors open *will* most definitely increase the power consumption of the cooling system by quite a lot, since before it was a limited amount of air to be cooled down, and now it is practically an unlimited amount of air that has to be cooled down. Yes, the objects keep their temperature for a short time, but leave the door open for a couple of hours and you see the effects there as well. In addition to virtually blowing money out of the air (because energy costs money, whether it is gas for your car or electricity for your house and your fridge).'], [u'DoNotPushHere', u""Trick question please: why doesn't the FLIR camera pick the air temperature itself?""], [u'Serachja', u'I would like to see an energy transfer and energy loss over time. I mean you are right, maybe due to a high heat capacity it doesn\'t change fast in temperature (what you see with your ir-lens) but the energy to cool down the entire array of high heat capacity objects is also larger than the energy needed to cool down the warmer air. To me the interesting point is\n""temperature"" * ""heat capacity"", not just temperature alone as in the end you pay for the energy consumption, not the ""change in temperature""'], [u'Patrick Hodson', u'My parents never said we were air conditioning the neighborhood, they always said we were letting the bought air out, which is precisely what you guys confirmed here.'], [u'GildedBear', u""I agree with the data and its collection but not your conclusion or premise.\n\nDad isn't mad because his chair is too cold or his food spoiled.

The first is thermodynamically impossible and dad doesn't care what the temperature of the yard is. Either way, it's wasted electricity that he still has to pay for, so close the door and stop trying to break the laws of physics. (oh, and while you're at it, get off the lawn you whippersnappers, nobody said you could play there)\n\nMore seriously, I had not considered that the objects would change temp slowly (though it makes sense and I have noticed it. it always takes longer than you want for the drinks to get cold and the ice to freeze...) so thank you.""], [u'This IS SPARTA', u'Please use the metric system as well for future videos.

Investigating the EQL magnetic insoles called Magstrides to see if there were physiological changes. This time lapse video will verify any physiology changes.

These  Thermography images are showing internal temperatures which are not affected by external heat sources. The dark through purple areas show a lack of internal temperatures while the red through white area show increased temperatures.
On the top right you will see ""Spot"" and then a temperature. The is the temperature at the white cross hairs on the foot on the left side of the video. As the temperature increase you will soon see a blossom of the internal temperature.

So what? The increase in temperature comes for the increased presence of the normal fluid flow through the body. That normal flow through the body brings waste removal and natural healing influences to the area.

RFniTvmVc1w,Direct Thermal vs. Thermal Transfer Printing,"There are two types of thermal labels: Direct Thermal and Thermal Transfer.  Thermal transfer and direct thermal labels are ideal for on-demand applications, especially those calling for variable data, barcoding, or human-readable numbering. There are advantages and disadvantages of direct thermal and thermal transfer labels and this video explains some of them. 

Thermal transfer labels require a ribbon when printing.Thermal  transfer printers apply heat to the thermal printhead, which transfers the image through a wax and/or resin ribbon to the label. Thermal transfer ribbons come in various colors, so you are not limited to black print. With thermal transfer labels, the image is crisp, durable and fairly scratch resistant. If you need a label that lasts a year or longer, use thermal transfer labels. Some examples of thermal transfer labels are: asset tagging, inventory identification, laboratory specimens, outdoor and freezer applications.
 
Direct thermal printers apply heat to the thermal printhead, activating the direct thermal media. Through a chemical reaction, the label turns dark where the heat is applied. With direct thermal labels, there is no ink, toner, or ribbon consumable - the only supply needed is the direct thermal labels. Direct thermal labels are less costly because you don't have to buy a ribbon. The downside to direct thermal labels is that they are not scratch resistant and will start to turn when exposed to lighting, making them hard to read. Use direct thermal labels for short term applications and when you want to print without a ribbon. Some examples of direct thermal labels are: shipping labels, name tags, receipts, pick tickets and visitor passes. 

To tell the difference between a thermal transfer and a direct thermal label, quickly and forcefully draw your fingernail across the label, like you are striking a match. It may take a couple of times depending on the media. If a dark mark appears, it is a direct thermal label.

For more information or to order these kind of labels, contact a product specialist at 1-800-446-1991.",RACO Industries,8/1/2013 13:11,34841,0:02:13,,,4.636363506,,8,"[[u'izri1', u""If the thermal print can only stay good for about a year, then what's the use of for me to buy a thermal printer if i want to keep my prints longer?""], [u'Sam Soto', u'Thank you,'], [u'Steven Jeffers', u'Super helpful'], [u'ROB NATION', u'Thanks!

The â€œRâ€ version retains all of the capabilities of the original VUE PRO, such as on-board recording, camera control via PWM interface and MAVLink integration. However, it adds a calibrated radiometric capability to the camera's output, meaning that rather than simply discerning whether or not one pixel is warmer or colder than its neighbor and producing an image from that data, it can actually provide a specific temperature reading for each pixel within the frame, plus or minus five degrees Fahrenheit, or five percent of the subject's temperature.

tsEXhLvX1zY,Thermogram,"http://www.revelationtv.com Infrared thermography (IRT), thermal imaging, and thermal video are examples of infrared imaging science. Thermographic cameras usually detect radiation in the long-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum (roughly 9,000â€“14,000 nanometers or 9â€“14 Âµm) and produce images of that radiation, called thermograms. Since infrared radiation is emitted by all objects with a temperature above absolute zero according to the black body radiation law, thermography makes it possible to see one's environment with or without visible illumination. The amount of radiation emitted by an object increases with temperature; therefore, thermography allows one to see variations in temperature. When viewed through a thermal imaging camera, warm objects stand out well against cooler backgrounds; humans and other warm-blooded animals become easily visible against the environment, day or night. As a result, thermography is particularly useful to the military and other users of surveillance cameras.

uyWKJ2o9gPM,Can Drones Use Thermal Imaging to Save Fish?,"In this episode, the Roswell Flight Test Crew travels to an experimental farm operated by West Virginia University in Morgantown, to test the feasibility of using a multirotor drone aircraft equipped with a FLIR thermal imaging camera to detect variations in surface water temperature. The goal of the project is to identify cold water thermal refugia, to guide habitat restoration for an endangered species of native brook trout. Using a combination of the aircraft's GPS system and a series of thermal targets on the ground at known, fixed locations, it will be possible to map the exact location of the observations using GIS technology. During their visit to the farm, the crew also briefly demonstrated the possibility of using the drone to count livestock.

A first look at the brand new FLIR One for iOS and Android. The FLIR One is an add-on infrared sensor for your smartphone and together with the app turns it into a highly portable thermal imaging camera. 

From the Video:

Hello, my Name is Ksenia and I'm here at Distrelec in Zuerich. Today we're going to show you the latest infrared sensor Flir One for your smart phone. We all know these high-end cameras with a lot of features and high resolution, but not everybody needs all those features. That's why Flir introduced the Flir One last year, for the iPhone 5. And today we would like to show you the new Flir One, more compact and available both for Aplle iOS and Android. So we don't Need this old device anymore and we can trash it :-)

Infrared technology is available for everyone now, and it's easy too! Just install the app, connect your Flir One and you're ready to go. Let's see what we have in the box: Here we have the Flir infrared sensor, a special protective cover, a USB cable to Charge it and there's even a strap to hang it around your neck. 

Let's see it in action. Here we have a soldering iron, a fan and there's a hotspot on our table; let's see what it is: Ah, it's a resistor getting hot. It's very useful in low light too, you can even find a person in total darkness. 

Main Features:
- Detector Resolution: 160 x 120 Pixel
- Temperature Range: -20 to +120Â° Celsius
- Weight: 30 gramms

But perhaps one of the best features of the Flir One for iOS and Android is that's so transportable. You never need to be onsite without a thermal Imaging camera.

Thank you for watching :-) Bye bye
